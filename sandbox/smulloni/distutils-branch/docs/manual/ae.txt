Introduction
============

This chapter discusses the APIs available in SkunkWeb. It will review
usage of the APIs in both Python and STML contexts.


The Application Environment Component API
=========================================

The AE ("Application Environment") package provides interfaces to
allow developers to develop component-based web
applications. Components, for AE, are executable files such as Python
scripts or STML pages that can be compiled to Python bytecode and are
included in the flow of applications.

Components can allow developers to section out pieces of code, with
the goal to reuse or to logically separate their applications in a
number of distinct files. Furthermore, the output of many components
can be cached to increase performance of the application server.

AE is closely integrated into the SkunkWeb request/response process by
the templating service, which provides an interface to execute
application code when a user requests a page on a SkunkWeb server.  In
what follows, therefore, they will be discussed together.

Understanding Components
------------------------

From the developer's point of view, components in AE are text files
written in a supported extension language (most usually, Python or
STML) which are included in the flow of an application by a
potentially nested series of "component calls".  They may contain any
code, presentational or logical, required for a SkunkWeb-based
application to function.

There are three types of components, each of them intended for a
different purpose:

**regular**
    
    When a regular component is called, it is passed a dictionary of
    component arguments, and the code it contains is executed in a
    separate namespace containing them.  During execution, standard
    output is redirected, and anything the code writes to it is
    captured and returned. Regular components are thus very convenient
    for the generating text output.

**include** 

    An include is similar to a regular component, except that it is
    executed in the namespace of its calling component rather than in
    a separate scope, and therefore it does not accept component
    arguments.  Because it shares the namespace of its caller, it can
    access and mutate the caller's environment without  restriction.  

**data** 

    This type of component is executed in its own scope, like a
    regular component, and similarly can be passed component
    arguments.  However, while the value returned from a regular
    component call is a string gathered implicitly by redirecting and
    spooling standard output during component execution, data
    components must either explicitly return a value, which can be any
    kind of Python data, not just a string, or the return value will
    be None.

All of these component types can be called with the
``callComponent()`` function in the ``AE.Component`` module. Each type
of component is called like this::

    from AE import Component
    Component.callComponent("my.comp", 
                            argDict={}, 
                            defer = None, 
                            compType=Component.DT_XX, 
                            cache = XX, 
                            srcModTime=None)
    
In the component call, we need to specify a few arguments to call the component:

**name** 

    We must specify the path to the component within the document
    root.  Both relative and absolute paths are permitted.  The root
    path, "/", is translated to mean the current document root of the
    document root filesystem (which itself is virtual; see `The
    SkunkWeb Virtual FileSystem`_).  Paths may include "..", but a
    path which escapes the document root is not permitted.

**argDict**

    In the case of regular and data components, this dictionary, if
    not empty, should consist of string keys, which should be valid
    Python identifiers, whose associated values may be arbitrary
    Python objects (unless the component call is being cached, in
    which case the objects must be hashable -- see below).  The
    namespace in which the component is executed will be updated with
    this dictionary, so that code in the component will be able to
    refer to variables with the names of the dictionary's keys.  As
    include components are not executed in their own namespace, but
    share the namespace of the calling component, this mechanism is
    not employed with includes, and it is an error to pass a non-empty
    argDict to an include component.
   
**cache**

    This parameter specifies if and how the output of this particular
    component call is to be cached.  Acceptable values, which are
    defined in the ``AE.Component`` module, are:

    - NO: do not use the cache; execute the component and return the
      result, but do not save it.

    - YES: if there is a cache entry for the component with the given
      component arguments, and that entry has not expired, return the
      cached value; otherwise, execute the component and cache the
      output, storing it with a cache key that uniquely corresponds to
      the component path and the component arguments passed to it,
      before returning the result.

    - DEFER: similar to YES, except that if there is an *expired*
      cache entry matching the component path and arguments of this
      component call, return its cached value as if it had not
      expired, and then, after the request is complete, execute the
      component to create a new cache entry.  When the logic of an
      application permits this, this can offer a considerable
      improvement in speed, as users do not need to wait for a
      component to be executed and cached before receiving a response.

    - FORCE: This forces a component to be executed and cached
      regardless of whether an unexpired cache entry is available for
      the call.

    - OLD: This is the opposite of ``FORCE``. It returns whatever
      value is in the cache for a component call, regardless of
      whether it has expired. The only time it will execute the
      component is when there is no corresponding cache entry at all.

When using the ``cache`` parameter set to anything other than NO
(which is the default), there is an important restriction placed on
the sorts of arguments you can pass using the ``argDict`` parameter.
In order to be able to store component output in a disk cache in such
a way that it can be looked up later by component calls with the same
signature (that is, the same component path and component arguments),
AE needs to be able to map component signatures to unique string
representations, which are used as cache keys.  To do this, AE must be
able to create a hash value for each object.  Hashable objects, in
AE's sense (which is a little broader than the usual Python sense),
are:

    - Numbers, strings, dates and ``None``.

    - Tuples (immutable sequences), provided that if and only if all
      the items within the tuple are hashable.

    - Lists and dictionaries are not hashable in the usual Python
      sense. However, AE can make an exception here, as long as the
      items are either hashable or are lists or dictionaries. However,
      the component should not change the information in the list or
      dictionary. If it does change, it will only change *once*, but
      it will not appear in the cache, which will be used after the
      component is initially cached.

    - ``mx.DateTime`` objects are not hashable in the usual Python
      sense either, but you can get away with it here, since AE can
      make them look like they are hashable.

    - Any Python class you write *cannot* be used, *unless* you
      implement a __hash__ or __cachekey__ method in the class.

**compType**

    This parameter declares what type of component it is.  The
    possible values, defined in the DT package but available in
    AE.Component as well, are ``DT_REGULAR``, ``DT_INCLUDE``, and
    ``DT_DATA``. 

**defer**
    [TODO]
  
**srcModTime**
    [TODO]

(We specify the timeout value in
    the actual component itself.)

Further discussion about each type of component is further discussed
in later sections.

The templating Service's Top-Level Documents
--------------------------------------------

When the templating service is being used, an HTTP request for a URL
may be mapped to a request for a **top-level document**, depending on
the server configuration and the kind of resource being requested.
This is actually a regular component call.  For example, if we had a
Python script called ``index.py`` located in our server's document
root, we could access it via the URL
``http://localhost:8080/index.py``.  Top-level documents are the only
URL-accessible components.  When a top-level document is called, the
code it contains is executed in a namespace which contains the
``CONNECTION`` variable, which is the interface in SkunkWeb to the
HTTP request and response.  (For more information about the
``CONNECTION`` variable, consult the section *The SkunkWeb HTTP API*,
later in this chapter.)  The top-level document may in turn call other
components, either to include their output into the response output
stream, or to obtain data from them for other manipulation.

Remote Components
-----------------

SkunkWeb can pass data or receive data from other SkunkWeb servers
through the use of remote components. You can set up a remote SkunkWeb
server, for example, to manage database connections, from which other
SkunkWeb servers can receive data from the database using the SkunkWeb
server setup to manage and output remote components.

    As with regular and data components, the calling page does not
    share namespaces with the remote data component.

    .. actually, remote components aren't a "kind" of component in
       the same way that regular/data/include are.  They are a
       different component protocol, and are called the same way.
       All remote components are either includes, data components,
       or regular components.  The use of remote components for
       data is typical, though.

[TODO]


File Extensions
---------------

By default, SkunkWeb comes with a number of acceptable file extensions
which SkunkWeb knows about. Here is a list of file extensions:

- HTML/STML files:
    * ``.html``
    * ``.stml``
- STML includes and regular components:
    * ``.inc``
- STML data components:
    * ``.dcmp``
- Python files:
    * ``.py``
- Python includes and regular components:
    * ``.pyinc``
- Python data components:
    * ``.pydcmp``


Includes And Regular Components
-------------------------------

To start off, let's demonstrate how we would include a simple page,
called "template.pyinc". To AE, the ".pyinc" extension means that it
is an include, either an STML or a Python script::

    from AE import Component
    
    a = Component.callComponent("template.pyinc", argDict={}, compType=Component.DT_INCLUDE)
    print a

Notice two things here. First, we don't specify anything for the
``argDict``; the include shares the same namespace as the calling
document. Second, our ``compType`` is ``Component.DT_INCLUDE``,
denoting that this is just a simple include. Note that the variable
``DT_INCLUDE`` is in the ``AE.Component`` module. At the end, we can
just print the results.


Here is an example of a call to a regular component::

    from AE import Component
    someVal = "moo"
    a = Component.callComponent("template.pycomp", 
                                argDict={'someVal': someVal}, 
                                compType=Component.DT_REGULAR,
                                cache=Component.YES)
    print a


Things look very different here. First, as you can see, we are passing
a value into the ``argDict``: ``someVal``. Second, we are using the
``cache`` parameter, where we specify the variable from
``AE.Component`` of what the cache type it should be. Finally, we
specify that it is a regular component in the ``compType`` parameter.
(The compType must match the actual type of the file.)

In STML, an include component can be called using the ``<:include:>``
tag; for example::

    <:include template.pyinc:>
    
For an STML regular component, you would use the <:component:> tag::

    <:component template.pycomp 
                someVal=`someVal` 
                cache=yes:>

You can pass a dictionary, just like with ``argDict`` in
``callComponent()`` by using ``__args__`` in the tag::

        <:component template.pycomp 
               __args__=`{'CONNECTION': CONNECTION, 
                          'someVal': someVal}` 
               cache=no:>

Any arguments specified in ``__args__`` is overridden by the values
that are explicitly defined in the tag. For example::

    <:component foo.comp a="3" __args__=`{'a':"5", 'b': 5}`:>
    
In this case ``a`` would equal ``3`` in the component.

In STML, the ``cache`` parameter can have anyone of these values,
which correlate with the values specified earlier in this section:

- ``yes``
- ``no``
- ``defer``
- ``force``
- ``old``

Data Components
---------------

Data components, as mentioned, are components that return a single
value. The value can be cached. This is useful if you have a piece of
code that will usually output the same value; a data component that is
cached does not need to be re-executed to get the value.

Data components can be called like this::

    from AE import Component
    someVal = "moo"
    a = Component.callComponent("pyCode.pydcmp", 
                                argDict={'spoon' : 'runcible', 
                                         'someVal': someVal}, 
					 compType=Component.DT_DATA,
					 cache=Component.DEFER )
    print a
    
This is very similar to how a regular component would look, except it
uses the ``Component.DT_DATA`` variable to specify that it is a data
component.

In the data component, you need to return a single value. Since we do
not have a ``<:return:>`` function in Python as we do in STML, we need
to instead raise an exception. The value of the exception is the data
we wish to pass through. Using ``raise``, we pass the ``ReturnValue``
exception and then supply the value for it::

    cow = "moo"
    raise ReturnValue, cow
    
In this data component, ``cow`` receives a value of ``moo``. Then the
``ReturnValue`` exception is raised, with the value of ``cow``. So, we
might have the below code that calls the above data component::

    from AE.Component import *
    animalSound = callComponent("cow.pydcmp", 
                                argDict={'CONNECTION': CONNECTION, 
                                         'someVal': someVal}, 
                                compType=Component.DT_DATA)

The value of ``animalSound`` equals ``moo``.

In STML,

Component Cache Timeouts
------------------------

Regular and data components can be cached. Those caches can
expire. When they expire, they are automatically refreshed. [TODO: Is
there a default expiration?] You can set the expiration time of a
particular data or regular component by setting the global variable
``__expiration`` in the component itself. You need to specify how many
seconds passed since the Unix epoch (12:00 AM 1/1/1970 UTC) when the
component cache should expire. Since we do not have enough fingers
and/or enough patience to count how many seconds it will be when the
component should expire, we can use a nifty little utility in the
SkunkWeb pylibs called ``Date.TimeUtil`` to solve this little woe.

We could, for example, have a specific component expire in five
minutes. We can use the ``convertDuration()`` function to specify our
expiration::

    import Date.TimeUtil
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertDuration("5m")

Note the argument usage in this function. You specify the integer
value and then a letter-identifier to express the amount the duration
covers. Here is a list of values that can be used:

*integer* **d**
    Cache for integer number of days. 
*integer* **h**
    Cache for integer number of hours. 
*integer* **m**
    Cache for integer number of minutes. 
*integer* **s**
    Cache for integer number of seconds. 
    
In STML, a component can use the <:cache:> tag to express duration::

    <:cache duration=5m:>
    
There is another function that can be used to express when the cache
should expire. This is the ``Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil()``
function. This can be also used in the STML ``<:cache:>`` tag, using
the ``until`` parameter.

The ``convertUntil()`` function can take a number of different
parameter strings depending on the caching requirements of your
particular component.

- The function can take a string in the form ``"hh:mm"`` or
  ``"hh:mm:ss"``. This specifies the hours and minutes (and optionally,
  seconds) on the 24-hour clock. This tells AE to expire the cache until
  the next occurence of that time. For example::

    import Date.TimeUtil
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil("14:00")
    
  This component will expire everyday at 2 PM. If the component is first
  cached at ``13:30``, or 1:30 PM, then the cache will be refreshed at 2
  PM. If the component is first cached at ``15:00`` or 3 PM, then it
  will expire 23 hours after the initial creation of the component
  cache. You can also specify multiple times like such::

    import Date.TimeUtil
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil(("14:00", "23:00"))

  In STML, the above will look like this::

    <:cache until=`("14:00", "23:00")` :>
    
  The cache here will expire at 2PM and at 11PM everyday.

- The function can just take a minute string, in the form of
  ``:mm``. The cache, when specified as such, will expire, every hour,
  at the minute you specify. For example, if you want to expire at 15
  past the hour, you can do this::
    
    import Date.TimeUtil
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil(":15")

  In STML, it will look like this::

    <:cache until=:15 :>
    
  Multiple minutes can be expressed, by placing the time in a tuple::

    import Date.TimeUtil
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil((":00", ":15", ":30", ":45"))

  Every fifteen minutes, the cache will expire. This can be expressed in STML like this::

    <:cache until=`(":00", ":15", ":30", ":45")`:>

- You can use a ``DateTime`` object to represent the time when it
  refreshes the cache. The date and time used can come from a database,
  for example, where and when the data is properly marshaled as a
  ``DateTime`` instance. [TODO: Example]

- You can refresh the cache at a specific date and time, using the ISO
  format ``"yyyy-mm-dd"``, ``"yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm"``, ``"yyyy-mm-dd
  hh:mm:ss"`` or US format, ``"mm/dd/yyyy"``, ``"mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm"``,
  ``"mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss"``. So, if you have a specific component that
  should expire once in its lifetime, you would do something like this:

    import Date.TimeUtil
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil("2003-08-01 07:00")
    
  This will expire on August 1, 2003 at 7 AM. In STML, it would look like this::

    <:cache until="2003-08-01 07:00":>

  Again, you can specify multiple dates by putting the date strings into a tuple::

    import Date.TimeUtil
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil(("2003-08-01 07:00", "2004-08-01 07:00"))

  And in STML:

    <:cache until=`("2003-08-01 07:00", "2004-08-01 07:00")`:>
    
- You can use a ``RelativeDateTime`` object from the ``DateTime``
  module a a parameter. This allows you to specify a very detailed time,
  like "expire every Sunday at noon." It is wise to read the
  ``RelativeDateTime`` documentation fully, or else you might write
  ``RelativeDateTime`` code that moves backwards in time. If this does
  happen, an exception will be raised. If you wanted to do the above,
  you can write this::

    import Date.TimeUtil, DateTime.RelativeDateTime
    __expiration = Date.TimeUtil.convertUntil(DateTime.RelativeDateTime(weekday=0, hour=12, minute=0, second=0))

  In STML it would be::

    <:cache until=`RelativeDateTime(weekday=0, hour=17, minute=0, second=0)`:>
    

Every item above can be grouped together in tuples; different formats
can also be that are mentioned above can be grouped together. This can
allow you to make a complex cache control on your components. Here is
an example in STML of what is meant by this::

    # expires the cache at 0, 15, 30, and 45 minutes after the hour
    <:cache until=`(":00", ":15", ":30", ":45")`:>

    # expires the cache at 15 minutes after the hour,
    # and also at 06:00 every day, and also
    # at 5pm (17:00) on Sundays.
    <:import DateTime "RelativeDateTime":>
    <:cache until=`(":15", "06:00", 
        RelativeDateTime(
        weekday=0, hour=17, 
        minute=0, second=0))`:>



Component Stack
---------------

[TODO: Consider: Even though this is quite useful sometimes, this is part of the 
implementation of components and can promote poor design. I am thinking of just 
removing this and leave this as a "secret hack" that those in-the-know know 
about.]

In the execution of components, you might have a component called on
the page that the user requests. In the component which you called on
the requesting page, another component is called, which may further
execute some of your code. In the execution of the components, each
component is put into a Python list called ``componentStack``. The
``componentStack`` contains each component's namespace, the name of
the component and passed arguments. This stack is globally available,
which means that, for example, you can extract any variable or
function defined in one component and use it within another.  (That
doesn't mean that it is good practice to do so, however.)

The component stack only exists with data and regular components, as
includes share the same namespace as the calling document.

For example, if we have two components, ``my.pycmp`` and
``myOther.pydcmp``, where the first one, ``my.pycomp`` is called in
the requesting document::

    out=AE.Component.callComponent("my.pycmp", 
                                   argDict={'action': action}, 
                                   compType=AE.Component.DT_REGULAR)

and in ``my.pycomp``, we call the ``myOther.pydcmp`` component::

        val=AE.Component.callComponent("myOther.pydcmp", 
                                       argDict={'action': action}, 
                                       compType=AE.Component.DT_DATA)

    
What we created is a "stack" of components, where the requesting
document is on the top of the stack, and ``myOther.pydcmp`` is on the
bottom of the stack.

The component stack is accessible through the ``componentStack``
variable, which is an attribute of of the ``AE.Component`` module.

The component stack is relative to where the execution currently
lies. If ``myOther.pydcmp`` has completed execution, then the top of
the component stack is now ``my.pycmp`` and ``myOther.pydcmp`` will
no longer be available. Because of this, you can really only "look
down" the component stack, not up.

To display how this might look, we will use a little Python code in
``myOther.pydcmp`` to demonstrate, using our example::

    from AE.Component import componentStack

    # this is all the information in the requested document.
    requestingDocument = componentStack[0] 
    
    # this is the second component called in execution.
    mypydcmp = componentStack[1] 
    
    # this is the last component in the list. This can only be accessed by the          
    # current component - (myOther.pydcmp)
    myOtherpydcmp = componentStack[2]
    
In this example, ``requestingDocument`` does not know of the existence
of the last item in the stack - it thinks itself is the last item in
the stack! It only "knows" the existence of another component, which
it will "allow" it to be the last item in the stack. This goes through
the line of executing components - the very last component (or the top
component) "knows" the "complete order" of the executing components in
its specific execution order, but lower ones only "know" what is below
it.

Each index in the ``componentStack`` is actually an object containing
a number of attributes that represent things within a specific
component. (For them geeky types, the ``componentStack`` list index
item is actually an instance of the AE.Component.ComponentStackFrame
class.) Below is a a list of attributes in a component stack index:

**name**

    The value of this attribute equals the relative path and name of
    the component you are retrieving information from. If you were
    retreiving the name of ``my.pydcmp`` in ``myOther.pydcmp``, we
    would use something like this::
    
        print componentStack[1].name
    
**namespace**

    This is a dictionary of all the variables, modules, packages,
    functions and classes imported into the particular namespace. So,
    if you want to grab a variable, possibly called "foo" in the
    requesting document, which is the bottom of the stack, you can do
    this::

        print componentStack[0].namespace.get("foo")
    
    If you had a function called ``bar()``, you can grab it in the
    current components namespace::

        myFunc = componentStack[0].namespace.get("bar")
        print myFunc()

**executable**

    This is an object that contains the executable code for the
    specific component. This attribute is an object of either
    ``AE.Executables.PythonExecutable`` or
    ``AE.Executables.STMLExecutable``, depending on what the component
    is. No matter what, they both have the same methods, though
    implemented differently.

    The outputted object contains two methods, ``mergeNamespaces()``
    and ``run()``. ``mergeNamespaces()`` would be used to merge two
    namespaces together, let's say after a data component raises the
    ``ReturnValue`` exception, to pass data to the calling
    component. [TODO: write more about this when this is figured out.]
    ``run()`` contains the actual code that can be executed.

    The best advice here is that if you absolutely need to re-execute
    a component, then it is here to use. However, be *absolutely
    aware* that if you use ``run()``, you can end up with a
    RuntimeError exception, if the component you are re-executing
    calls the currently executing component (ala, recursion overload.)

    To reach the recursion depth for your Python installation, you can do this::
        
        b = componentStack[1].executable
        b.run()
        

**argDict**

    This is a dictionary containing the list of arguments passed to
    the specific component. If you called ``my.pydcmp`` like this::
        
        AE.Component.callComponent("my.pydcmp", 
                                   argDict={'action': 'search'}, 
                                   compType=DT_REGULAR)

    Then the dictionary represented in the ``argDict`` parameter in
    ``callComponent()`` will be accessible through this attribute.


**auxArgs**
    [TODO: Need to look at this more]

**compType**

    The value of this attribute, which represents the type of
    component used. Here is a list of the component types and their
    corresponding values:

        - DT_REGULAR: 0
        - DT_DATA: 1
        - DT_INCLUDE: 2


There is another variable in ``AE.Component`` to be aware of, and that
is ``topOfComponentStack``. [TODO: Finish this.]

Component Stack Advice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since you have full access to every other components attributes in a
currently executing component, a lot of power is handed to you. If you
absolutely require it, then it is okay to use it. But generally, if
there is a lot of "hopping" around the component stack, without using
the proper facilities (like ``argDict`` in ``callComponent()``) the
complexity of your code is bound to increase.

For most occasions, the dictionary of values you pass in the
``argDict`` parameter in the ``callComponent()`` function will be the
values that you will be using throughout each of your components. It
is best to stick with those and only use the above features when your
application absolutely demands it (or you wrote yourself into a hole
you can't get out.)


Caching Functions
-----------------

[TODO]


Logging
-------

AE provides an interface to allow your application to log certain
events and the like in default logs. The logging functions are in
``AE.Logs``.


Message Catalogs
----------------


Message Catalogs, for SkunkWeb, serve two purposes. First, if you want
to have a single location where all of your error messages and such
are held (thus making error messages easier to modify since you don't
have to go through a bunch of templates to make changes), you can use
a message catalog, and then just reference that message catalog in
your template. The other reason you might want to use it is if you
have a multi-lingual site and you need to easily switch between
languages depending on the request.

A message catalog is just a basic Python dictionary held in a file. If
you had a file called "messages.cat", it can contain something like
this::

    {'english': {'welcome': 'Welcome to the site!', 
        'goodbye': 'Have a nice day!'}}

(Simple message catalogs start with `.msg`; multi-lingual catalogs
usually start with `.cat`.)

To call the message catalog, in STML, you would just type something
like this::

    from AE.Cache import getMessageCatalog
    from AE.MsgCatalog import getMessage
    
    myCat = getMessageCatalog("catalogs/messages.cat")
    print getMessage(myCat, "welcome", "english")
    
in STML::       
    
    <:catalog catalogs/messages.cat myCat:>
    <:msg myCat welcome lang=english:>

The first line loads up the file containing your message catalog. The
second line displays the contents of the message ``welcome`` in the
``english`` dictionary. Note the parameters in the ``<:msg:>`` tag -
in ``<:catalog:>`` we place the contents of ``messages.cat`` into
``myCat``, and then in the second line, we access ``myCat`` to get the
item ``welcome`` under the language ``english``.

If you had two languages, for example::

    {'english': {'welcome': 'Welcome to the site!', 'goodbye': 'Have a nice day!'}, 
     'piglatin': {'welcome': 'Elcomway otay hetay itesay!', 'goodbye': 'Avehay ay icenay ayday!'}}

You can access the second language like this::

    from AE.Cache import getMessageCatalog
    from AE.MsgCatalog import getMessage
    
    myCat = getMessageCatalog("catalogs/messages.cat")
    print getMessage(myCat, "welcome", "piglatin")

in STML::

    <:catalog catalogs/messages.cat myCat:>
    <:msg myCat welcome lang=piglatin:>

What would output is: ``Elcomway otay hetay itesay!``. If the
``welcome`` did not exist, then it would just output a blank string.

You can do a little variable substitution in your message catalog. For
example, if you wanted to have the welcome message say ``Welcome to
the site, John!``, but have the name change depending on different
circumstances, you can do this: add a variable in the message catalog
and then add the variable name in your ``<:msg:>`` tag or in the
``getMessage()`` function. This is what the message catalog can look
like::

    {'english': 
    {'welcome': 'Welcome to the site, [[name]]!'}}

When you call it in STML, like so::

    <:catalog catalogs/messages.cat messages:>
    <:msg messages welcome lang=english name=John:>

or in Python::

    from AE.Cache import getMessageCatalog
    from AE.MsgCatalog import getMessage
    
    myCat = getMessageCatalog("catalogs/messages.cat")
    print getMessage(myCat, "welcome", "english", {'name': 'John'})


The ``name`` in the message catalog is replaced with the name that you
use in the ``<:msg:>`` tag or the ``getMessage()`` function.

``<:msg:>`` also has a parameter, similar to that in the ``<:val:>``
tag, where it allows you to format the results. The ``fmt`` parameter
can take any one of these string parameters:

 * "plain" or "plaintext": No escaping. This is the default.
 * "latin" or "latinquote": Escape only extended characters to ISO Latin1 entities: ’ become &iacute;, etc.
 * "html" or "htmlquote": Escape only things that would break HTML formatting: ``< >`` ``&`` ``\`\``` ``'``. These characters are escaped to the named HTML entities for them: ``&lt;``, etc.
 * "uri", "url", "uriquote" or "urlquote": Escape all URL-unsafe characters to %XX format.
 * "fulluri" or "fullurl": Escape every character into URL-safe %XX format.
 * "base64": base64 encodes the string.

In Python, you would use the ``DT.DTCommon.ValFmtRgy`` list to specify
the format to use.

So, if you have some type of character in your message that looks
oddly familiar to a angle bracket, used in HTML, you can use, for
example, the ``html`` formatting to fix that. Here is an example of
the message catalog:

    {'english': 
    {'welcome': 'Welcome to the site, <[[name]]>!'}}

To get the above message to display correctly, we would do something like this::

    from AE.Cache import getMessageCatalog
    from AE.MsgCatalog import getMessage
    from DT.DTCommon import ValFmtRgy
    
    myCat = getMessageCatalog("catalogs/messages.cat")
    print getMessage(myCat, "welcome", "english", ValFmtRgy["html"])
    

In STML::

    <:catalog catalogs/messages.cat myCat:>
    <:msg myCat welcome lang=english fmt=html name=Brian:>


This will output::

    Welcome to the site, <Brian>!

Without the `fmt=html`, we would get this::

    Welcome to the site, !

(At least in the browser screen. You can see this if you saw the source code of the final output.)

(One final note, message catalog messages can only be strings. No lists, no integers, just strings.)


Uses Of Message Catalogs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The original intention of message catalogs was to allow easy switching between multiple languages, particularly Spanish, English and Portuguese. But given the fact that the name of the "language" you specify is merely a dictionary key value, you can basically use any type of key you want, even if the parameter in ``<:msg:>`` for something like this is ``lang``. 

If you are not building a multi-lingual site, you can still use the ``lang`` parameter ... maybe one can separate specific error messages and the like into separate categories, or by separate modules,  all retrievable by what you specify for what the "language" is. 

I have two sections on my site, for example, called "search" and "add". Here could be my message catalog::

    {'search': {'noRecordsFound': 'There were no records found'}, 'add': {'addError': 'The item could not be added.}}

Now, if an error comes up, like in a search, I can have this code execute::

    <:if `error`:>
        <:catalog catalogs/messages.cat errorMsg:>
        <:msg errorMsg noRecordsFound  lang=search:>
    <:/if:>


So, if there is an error, `There were no records found` will display.

Configuration Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two configuration options in ``sw.conf`` that is related to message catalogs:

**DefaultLanguage**
     Here, we specify the language to use if the ``lang`` parameter is not specified in the ``<:msg:>`` parameter.

**strictMessageCatalogs** 
    if set to 1, it will return an error if you ask for a message that is not available in the catalog. This is turned off by default, meaning that it will just return a blank string instead.


Miscellaneous Functions
-----------------------

**AE.Component.rectifyRelativeName()**
    This will return the full path of path as taken as relative to the directory of the currently executing component. For example: if the currently executing component is /foo/bar/baz.comp calling::

        AE.Component.rectifyRelativeName('.')

    will return ``/foo/bar/`` and::

        AE.Component.rectifyRelativeName('doofus')

    will return ``/foo/bar/doofus`` and::

        AE.Component.rectifyRelativeName('/absolute/path')

    will return ``/absolute/path``. 


Configuration Options For AE
----------------------------

Each part of AE has a certain number of parameters, to be defined in ``sw.conf`` that relates to its operation.

General Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These parameters are general in focus and relate to all of AE in general.

**documentRoot**
    This parameter specifies the root of all the documents to be served are. So, when you type in, for example, ``http://www.example.com/index.py``, SkunkWeb will search for the ``index.py`` file, beginning in the document root you specify. The default is ``<SKUNKWEB_DIR>/docroot``. This parameter can be scoped, so SkunkWeb can serve out multiple applications with different document roots.

**documentRootFS**
    Here, you would specify the type of file system that is represented in the ``documentRoot`` parameter. Since SkunkWeb can support different types of "file systems", in the sense of how it gets specific files, you can specify different "virtual" file system implementations. Specifically, SkunkWeb can look for pages in .zip files and .tar files, intended to allow developers to package their solutions in a single file.

    By default, the ``documentRootFS`` parameter is ``vfs.LocalFS()``. If you plan to use archive files, then use ``vfs.MultiFS()``. 

    More information about using archive files to deliver your applications with SkunkWeb, read the *Product Services* section, later in this chapter.



Caching Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The caching parameters specified is intrinsically linked to how components are served from AE. Since caching is a critical part of AE, these parameters need to be set, depending on your application and the SkunkWeb configuration.

**componentCacheRoot**
    [TODO]

**compileCacheRoot**
    [TODO]
    
**useCompileMemoryCache**
    When this is set to ``1``, then the cache will reside in RAM instead of on disk. This will increase your memory footprint a little bit, but, at the same time, you might see some speed improvements - it eliminates disk I/O, and definitely, CPU utilization.

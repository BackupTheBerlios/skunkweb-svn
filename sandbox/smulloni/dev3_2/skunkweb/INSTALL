Supported Platforms
------------------------------
SkunkWeb has is known to compile and run under the following operating
systems:
    Linux
    Solaris

It should work on any reasonable version of Unix that Python works.
It *may* run on Windoze under Cygwin, but it hasn't been tested.


Prerequisites
------------------------------
Python 2.1.1 or later (2.1 works but is not GPL compatible)
  optionally compiled with the crypt module
Marc Andre Lemburg's eGenix mx Extensions (BASE)
    http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html#mxBASE
An ANSI C compiler

Optionally install apache.  Make sure you configure it with at least:
   --enable-module=so 
If you don't you will very likely have a *very* bad day
If you run into problems, try configuring apache with these additional 
  switches:
   --disable-module=dir --disable-module=autoindex


Installation
------------------------------

Installing SkunkWeb should be rather painless since it makes use of
GNU autoconf.  Just untar and run configure.  Make sure that apache's
bin/ directory is in your path (or alternatively specify the
--with-apxs directive) if you are going to build the mod_skunkweb
Apache module. Outside of the usual configure options, the following
configure options are also available:

  --with-skunkweb       Install SkunkWeb as part of this installation 
                        (default yes)
  --with-python=/path/python   Specify path to python executable
  --with-user=user        Make Skunk installation owned by user
  --with-group=group      Make Skunk installation owned by group

Additional options if building SkunkWeb:
  --with-webdoc           Install some sample content
  --with-services=svcs    Specify the list of services to install
                           space delimited list of services to install;
                           valid names are:

                           sessionHandler, requestHandler, remote,
                           ae_component, remote_client, aecgi,
                           httpd, basicauth, pars, web, templating,
                           oracle, postgresql, mysql
                          Default is to install them all

  --with-sudo=/path/sudo  Specify path to sudo
  --without-mod_skunkweb  Don't build mod_skunkweb
  --with-apxs=/path/apxs  Specify path to the apxs program

Once ``configure'' has completed, simply type ``make; make install''.

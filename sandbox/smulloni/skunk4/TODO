Reload is broken for socketmgr, because the connection list is lost.
This can be made a constructor argument, but generally configuration
needs to be integrated now so that it can be re-read on HUP.  Then
reset() can really reset, rather than just clearing connections out
and leaving some other module with the job of fixing them up again.

Reload is broken for socketmgr, because the connection list is lost.
This can be made a constructor argument, but generally configuration
needs to be integrated now so that it can be re-read on HUP.  Then
reset() can really reset, rather than just clearing connections out
and leaving some other module with the job of fixing them up again.
THIS IS DONE.

I'd like it if the config system could have qualified namespaces:

   server.connections=['whatever']
   sessions.something_or_other=4

It would help to keep things organized.  Otherwise, it is necessary to
use naming conventions, or have chaos.

The socket server should support SSL sockets.

Changes in 3.4.1
================
mvc service added


Changes in 3.4
==============
* http access logging, based on patch by JvD.
* fixes for sessionHandler.PostgreSQLSessionStore, which was 
  totally broken before.
* PyDO2 fixes. 
* PyDO and PyDO2 now make it easier to specify order by, limit, and offset.
* bug fixes for httpd and product service.
* bug fixes for mod_skunkweb for apache2.

Changes in 3.4b5
================
* a security fix put in hastily in 3.4b4 broke the
  product service; this was repaired.

Changes in 3.4b4
=================
* security fixes: cross-site scripting vulnerability in default
  404 page repaired (was including the literal uri in the page output);
  httpd service had been vulnerable to paths escaping the document root, 
  now isn't.
* better support for directory layout configuration options.
* vfs filesystems have a new method, "find_path", for cascading
  filesystems.
* new "cascade" component handler.
* formlib improvements.
* RPM spec.
* spool tag has new option, "comments", that controls componentCommentLevel
  within the spool.
* firebird connection cache added.
* "oneshot" hook functions.
* overhaul of sessionHandler service.
* cache reaper now clears all scoped caches by default.

Changes in 3.4b3
========================================
* vfs.LocalFS now follows symlinks by default.
* new usertracking service.
* DT.DTLexer now permits colons in the plaintext 
  state (you can now write <:url http://foo.com noescape=1:>
  without putting the url in quotes).
* fixes for Python 2.1 and Python 2.3a2 compatibility.
* an ISBN field added to formlib.
* httpd service now adds goodies to the environment.
* swmgr and swpython have additional command-line options.
* the postgresql service and PostgreSql connection cache
  have optional connection testing, as mysql has had for
  some time.
* fixes for sapdb and unicode in PyDO.
* new AE.Cache options, runOutOfCache, dontCacheSource and noTagDebug.
* can be run in the foreground (for use with daemontools).
* ported to HP/UX 11
* the Configuration object has been reimplemented, in Python, 
  with an order of magnitude  speed improvement for attribute 
  lookup.  Some backwards incompatibilities, which while numerous 
  are not likely to be a problem for most users:

  1. there is no longer an "__all__" attribute that gives you all keys.
  This is easily available by other means -- self.__dict__ is always
  a set of all the current scoped data.
  2. scope() now takes only one kind of argument, a dictionary.  (It
  used to take three different kinds of arguments, and behave in three
  entirely different ways).
  3. the old method names, _trim, _mergeDefaultsKw, etc., which had been
  maintained for backwards compatibility with an old version, are gone 
  and are no longer used in the codebase.
  4. there is no longer a "mashSelf" method.
  5. Before, if you wanted to set a configuration value temporarily, you
  had to use a combination of push() and pop().  That would probably
  still work, but you can also directly set the attribute, and then
  unset it later.
  6. pop() used to require a index, but the only index it ever made sense
  to use was 0; the index parameter is now dropped (and in fact the
  underlying array of dictionaries is kept in the opposite order).
  7. the scope matchers are no longer accessible as the "matchers"
  attribute, but through a method call: cfg.scopeMatchers().  This is
  to avoid mixing configuration variables, which are stored as instance 
  attributes, with anything else. 
  8. defaults() now returns a copy of the defaults, not the original.
  9. currentScopes, which used to be a "private" instance attribute, is
  now available through a method call: self.currentScopes().
  10. update() has been renamed to updateDefaults(), which more accurately
  describes what it does. 

  The speed increase may not make a huge difference for existing skunkweb
  applications, but it does mean that skunkweb developers can be less 
  concerned about the cost of new Configuration variable lookups in the 
  core.
* swpython can now be used in a #! line
* generates and checks Last-Modified headers for static content
* generates ETag headers (generateEtagHeader option)
* optionally compress text/* mime bodies (textCompression option)
* now supports HTTP byte range requests
* now has a docroot precompiler
* new pylibs: jsutils (marshals Python data to Javascript) and ccvalidate 
  (credit card validation)
* improved templating.MailServices and <:sendmail:> tag.


Changes in 3.4b2
========================================
* fix to argextract handling of kwargs.
* fix to vfs import hook's handling of packages.
* build system revised to work with Python 2.3a1; probably
  works on Cygwin now without adjustment (anyone want to 
  test that?)
* fixes for mysql support in PyDO.
* more rewrite enhancements.
* STML's HTML helper tags are now XHTML-compliant by default.
* fix for sessionHandler's FSSessionStore.
* fix for xmlrpchandler's system.methodSignature implementation.

Changes in 3.4b1
========================================
* an ftp filesystem for the vfs (vfs.ftpfs).
* a very simple xhtml generation library (ecs, named
  after Apache's similarly named Java library).
* a library for processing and managing html forms (formlib).
* an xmlrpc support module (xmlrpchandler).
* support for scoping on server port (SERVER_PORT).
* fixes for PyDO and swcgi.
* <:url:> now has an "abs" option which will generate
  absolute urls.
* substantial enhancements to rewrite service, which now
  permits nested (conditional) rules, and performs faster.
* support for pypgsql postgresql driver for SkunkWeb and PyDO.
* alternate PyDO implementation (PyDO.PyDO2) with new-style classes
  (hence Python 2.2+ only).  Permits attribute-style access to
  columns.

Changes in 3.3 
======================================== 
* Developer's manual updated
* fix to PyDO/mysql so that you can put NULL values into columns
* minor change to handling of python code files (__name__ is now set
  to '__main__' in the document namespace), so precompiled Cheetah
  templates work.
---3.3 beta 0 cut
* the build process was revised to facilitate changing the installed
  directory structure using standard configure options; FHS-compliant
  packaging and installation is now feasible.
* PSP support added.  For now should be considered alpha
* Prebuilt documentation is now included in the distribution (HTML and
  paper-formats in letter dimensions)
* now can have skunkweb started as root (can set who you actually want
  it to run as) so you can bind to low ports
* new extcgi service so you can run CGI's from SkunkWeb!
* new pycgi service for running Python CGI's in process -- still in
  alpha.
* vfs.FS has new method, split_extra(), that finds extra path info;
  the rewrite service has a new DynamicRewriter subclass,
  ExtraPathFinder, which takes advantage of it (although a simple
  rewrite rule is still more efficient to use when possible -- see the
  FAQ).
* fixed userModuleCleanup bugs when using MySQL service and/or used
  <:img:> tag with PIL installed.
* pydo/mysql now supports connection caching using the mysql service.
* PyDO documentation updates
* The userdir service will now function properly when operating with a
  scoped docroot
* Now converts non-native line-endings in exprs to the native line
  ending so that when editing templates on non-native machines,
  expressions will work properly
* auth service fix when using multiple auth schemes simultaneously --
  BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE AHEAD---
  If you customized the login/logout pages copied from the auth
  service directory, NOTE THE FOLLOWING CHANGE!!
  change the <:import SkunkWeb Configuration:> to <:import auth:>
  change the Configuration.authAuthorizer bits to auth.getAuthorizer().
  If you copied them and didn't change them, recopy them.
* the logger now handles some really bizarre cases that shouldn't ever
  happen in reality (but of course have, or I wouldn't have fixed
  them).  Oh the benefits of a machine with bad memory to make you
  test for things that shouldn't happen.

Changes in 3.2.3
========================================
* added support for the SCGI Protocol 
  - http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/
* document updates/revamps (currently stmlrefer)
* now is more persistant about the timeout exception (it's reraised each
  second after a timeout occurs)
* now should build with non-GNU makes (specifically BSD make)
* many fixes -- thanks to pychecker!
* fixed error handling weirdnesses

Changes in 3.2.2
========================================
* The <:compargs:> tag can now be used in an STML block (used to only work
  at the top level)
* Works with Python 2.1 again (broke in 3.2.1)
* new geeknews feed from python.org
* fixed lwn geeknews feed 
* added support for DCOracle2

Changes in 3.2.1 
========================================
* new auth service
* Assorted PyDO fixes, notably support for more PostgreSQL types
* Caching fix for stale 
* Apache 2 support.
* DateTime objects can now be used as arguments to cacheable components
* rewrite fixes and feature additions
* usual array of general bug fixes
* mod_skunkweb now properly reports its existence in the Server header
* UNIX socket fixes
* server restart fixes

Changes in 3.2 beta 3
========================================
* added a product service and product-packaging utility, which permits components and python
  modules, including services, to be bundled together and deployed.  Requires MultiFS as the 
  documentRootFS, which is now a single FS.
* userModuleCleanup now off by default.
* vfs fixes.
* MySQL fixes.
* rewrite service, for url rewriting (contributed by Spruce Weber)
* added extract_args method to HTTPConnection, corresponding to the STML <:args:> tag.
* Hook and KeyedHook now live in a pylib (hooks.py)

Changes in 3.2 beta 1
========================================
* pars removed (since we have zipfs and tarfs, pars is redundant)
* vfs fixes
* new vfs properties
* sapdb fix - Ulrich Eck
* remote component call exception fix
* beginnings of a test suite
* static/PyDO now *actually* works on Python 2.2

Changes in 3.2 beta 0
========================================
* remote component fixes
* doc updates
* caching fixes
* misc output fixes
* Now have a CGI adaptor -- swcgi.  See docs for details
* new image gallery demo, with auto-generated (and cached) thumbnails;
  requires PIL
* new suffixes for includes (.inc and .pyinc)
* optional enhancement to <:img:> tag if PIL is installed 
  (auto-generates height and width)
* many PyDO improvements, including a SAP driver and *three* 
  new ways of specifying custom WHERE clauses; pydoObj.get(column,
  default) will now return default where the value for column is
  NULL. 
* services can now easily provide mime-type-specific request 
  handlers
* upgraded MySQL support to use MySQLdb
* works with Python 2.2 as well as 2.1.x
* now accesses resources via a vfs layer; resources can be stored in 
  zip and tar archives as well as the local filesystem.  The pars
  service, which used a python-specific archive format, is no longer
  supported. 
* Because of the vfs, Configuration.documentRoot is being gradually
  phased out, and will probably not be present in 3.2 final.
  The new mechanism for controlling where resources come from is 
  Configuration.documentRootFS, which in this release, is a list of
  possible filesystems (for various reasons this will probably change
  quite soon to a single fs rather than a list).

Changes from 3.0 to 3.1
========================================
* Major performance tweaks.  Should now be about 30% faster overall.
* Now supports FastCGI
* PyDO improvements (mainly PostgreSQL related)
* new service - userdir - which makes it so that requests to /~user/foo
  will go to <users_home_directory>/public_html/foo
* print statements in <:call:> tags now work.
* <:call:> tag now handles multiline expr argument properly.  Now you
  can do things like:
<:call `def foo(x):
   return 'the value is %s' % x
print foo(3)`:>
* PostgreSQL fixes
* UNIX domain socket fixes
* PyDO classes can now be defined in non-modules
* Now can have a template that gets executed for directories that don't
  have an index document.

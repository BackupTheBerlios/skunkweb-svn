If you are going to use oracle, you need the DCOracle and SQL pacakges
-- available in the skunk package tarball under skunk/pylibs.

If you are going to use PostgreSQL, build and install the Python
interface located in it the PostgreSQL build tree under the
src/interfaces/python directory.

If you are going to use MySQL, get, build and install the Python MySQL
module.

Files of Note:
    overview      - An overview of PyDO and why it's cool
    example       - a walk through example on how to write PyDO objects
    doc           - a bit more granular detail on PyDO stuff
    conn.readme   - what the connection interface object looks like
    ogenscript.py - a cool PyDO class generator that grovels over the
                    Oracle system catalogs!  Run it with an account
                    that can see ALL_OBJECTS, ALL_TAB_COLUMNS,
                    ALL_CONSTRAINTS and SYS.ALL_CONS_COLUMNS and
                    answer a few questions and BAM!  most of the work
                    generating PyDO classes is done!
    pgenscript.py - similar to ogenscript, but works with PostgreSQL!

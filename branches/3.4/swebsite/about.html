<:spool contents:> SkunkWeb, invented by Drew Csillag and now also
hacked on by Jacob Smullyan is an extensible, scalable and easy to use
application server written in Python.

<H2>The Pitch</h2>

Uses Python
<ul>
<li>	  Python is easy to learn for both new programmers and experts alike
</li><li>	  senior programmer types like it too (vs. say tcl)
</li><li>	  extensible with C/C++ for speed and/or linkage to C/C++ libraries
          via static *or* dynamic linking
</li></ul>
Extensible
<ul>
<li>	  Relatively simple extension API
</li><li>	  can easily handle authentication, url building/parsing and custom
	  tags
</li></ul>
Encourages component based design
<ul>
<li>	  more than just "include"
</li><li>	  not just another ASP/JSP like thing
</li><li>	  a powerful templating language 
</li><li>	  encouraged by caching options (see below)
</li><li>	  component output can be either HTML or Python objects
</li><li>	  can write components in either STML or Python
</li><li>	  can also call components on other skunk servers
</li></ul>
	
Message Catalogs
<ul>
<li>	 makes multi-lingual sites much easier
</li><li>	 support variable substitution in messages
<li>
</ul>

Speed
<ul>
<li>	  templates are compiled to Python bytecode
</li><li>	  extensive caching (to disk and optionally memory) of:
<ul>
<li>		  compiled forms of templates
</li><li>		  digested message catalogs
</li><li>		  output of components
</li><li>		  python modules and python components
<li></ul>
</li><li>	  cache *is* sharable between machines if using a
	  shared filesystem! (can be more than one shared filesystem
          for speed, redundancy and flexibility)
</li><li>	  caching is flexible and as finite as your disk space
</li><li>	  components can be rendered after the response is sent if 
	  a slightly stale version is available --- resulting in
	  better response times
</ul>
Documentation
<ul>
<li>	 extensive documentation available in HTML, PostScript, PDF & text
          (ok, not yet, but getting there fast)
</li><li>	  have automatic documentation tools to generate documentation for 
	  STML templates and python modules (python components coming soon)
	  as well as tools for writing manuals.
</li></ul>

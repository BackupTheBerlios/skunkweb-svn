#    protocol.HTTPConnection : a connection object (request and response rolled into one)
#                              for templating engines

# Revision 1.1  2001/08/05 14:59:58  drew_csillag
# Initial revision
#
# Revision 1.8  2001/07/09 20:38:40  drew
# added licence comments
#
# Revision 1.7  2001/05/04 18:38:52  smullyan
# architectural overhaul, possibly a reductio ad absurdum of the current
# config overlay technique.
#
# Revision 1.6  2001/04/25 20:18:53  smullyan
# moved the "experimental" services (web_experimental and
# templating_experimental) back to web and templating.
#
# Revision 1.6  2001/04/04 18:11:36  smullyan
# KeyedHooks now take glob as keys.  They are tested against job names with
# fnmatch.fnmatchcase.   The use of '?' is permitted, but discouraged (it is
# also pointless).  '*' is your friend.
#
# Revision 1.5  2001/04/04 14:46:31  smullyan
# moved KeyedHook into SkunkWeb.Hooks, and modified services to use it.
#
# Revision 1.4  2001/04/02 00:02:53  smullyan
# integration of new hook framework (in requestHandler.hooks) into
# web_experimental and templating_experimental services.
#
# Revision 1.3  2001/04/01 07:27:34  smullyan
# after various wacky experiments, moved a prototype of a new hook
# implementation into requestHandler.hooks.py.
#
# Revision 1.2  2001/03/29 23:02:26  smullyan
# annotated job.py with indications of grandiose plans.  Job integration.
#
# Revision 1.1  2001/03/29 20:17:14  smullyan
# experimental, non-working code for requestHandler and derived services.

X fix clearCache w.r.t. name escapes from cache roots and (shell and regex) 
  quoting 

2.72.3

X put the socket into non-blocking mode when actually accept()ing so that

X make it so python lines in pycomps show up in tracebacks
X make it so that python datacomponents that don't return a value don't throw 
  an exception but return None
X remove syslog dependancy -- now optional
@ enable remote components over HTTP
  This turns out to be a bit more complicated when you factor security 
  into it...
@ SSL support for remote AED calls (may require python 2.1?)

Technet
--------------------
X make it so that teams are listed on the admin page, not bugtracking systems. 
X make it so that there is no system type input box on the system creation 
  screen since 'BUGTRACKING' is the only one we support
X make it so we can add categories to bugtracking systems.

mod_aecgi
--------------------
X make so mod_aecgi has an exclude directive.  If uri begins with argument,
    DECLINE the request.  This way you can have AED serve root, but have
    things like mailman in subordinate directories and have them served
    by apache directly
X Have failover/loadbalance scheme in mod_aecgi, so if primary server isn't
    available, can fail to another host (failover groups?).
X have it so you can set the connect timeout (if a host is totally down,
  it can take quite a while for the connect to fail).

Documentation
--------------------
X update stmlref with python component stuff -- make into general
    AED programming guide?
X create ops manual
X add argument to xref to not put in parentheses
@ update install doc -- superceded by operations manual

    module doc)

X mention site-libs in stmlref

Supported Platforms
------------------------------
SkunkWeb is known to compile and run under the following operating
systems:
    Linux
    Solaris
    FreeBSD
    HPUX 11
    MacOS 10.2
    Windows/Cygwin (sort of)

It should work on any reasonable version of Unix that runs Python 2.1
or later.



Prerequisites
------------------------------
Python 2.1.1 or later (2.1 works but is not GPL compatible)
  optionally compiled with the crypt module
Marc Andre Lemburg's eGenix mx Extensions (BASE)
    http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html#mxBASE
An ANSI C compiler

Optionally install apache.  Make sure you configure it with at least:

(for Apache 1.x)
   --enable-module=so 
(for Apache 2.x)
   --enable-so

If you don't you will have a *very* bad day If you run into problems
on Apache 1.x, try configuring apache with these additional
switches:
   --disable-module=dir --disable-module=autoindex


Installation
------------------------------

Installing SkunkWeb should be rather painless since it makes use of
GNU autoconf.  Just untar and run configure.  Make sure that apache's
bin/ directory is in your path (or alternatively specify the
--with-apxs directive) if you are going to build the mod_skunkweb
Apache module. Outside of the usual configure options, the following
configure options are also available:

  --with-skunkweb       Install SkunkWeb as part of this installation 
                        (default yes)
  --with-python=/path/python   Specify path to python executable
  --with-user=user        Make Skunk installation owned by user
  --with-group=group      Make Skunk installation owned by group

Additional options if building SkunkWeb:
  --with-webdoc           Install some sample content
  --with-sudo=/path/sudo  Specify path to sudo
  --without-mod_skunkweb  Don't build mod_skunkweb
  --with-apxs=/path/apxs  Specify path to the apxs program

Once ``configure'' has completed, simply type ``make; make install''.


Building the Documentation 
------------------------------ 
Now that the documentation is included in the SkunkWeb releases, the
need to build the documentation really only applies to people who want
it in A4 dimensions, or are editing the documentation themseleves, but
if you want to build them yourself, here's how:

If you've ever built the Python documentation from source, SkunkWeb's
is built pretty much the same way.

What you need:
   1) A working LaTeX2e installation (PDFLaTeX if you want PDF output)
   2) LaTeX2HTML 2K.1beta (1.47) if you want to build the HTML docs
      --other versions may work, but I've heard there may be problems.

There are three directories that correspond to the output type:
  html           HTML output  
  paper-letter   Paper formats (PS, DVI, PDF) for letter sized paper
  paper-a4       Paper formats (PS, DVI, PDF) for A4 sized paper

For HTML
----------
Go to the docs/html and type:
	make <docname>/<docname>.html
Where <docname> is one of:
     devel - the developer's manual
     opman - the operations (installation/care and feeding) manual
     stmlrefer - the STML reference manual

For Paper formats
--------------------
Go to either docs/paper-letter or docs/paper-a4 depending on what size
paper you're shooting for.  Then type:
	make <docname>.<ext>
Where <docname> is as in HTML way, and <ext> is one of ps, pdf or dvi,
depending, of course on what format you want it in.

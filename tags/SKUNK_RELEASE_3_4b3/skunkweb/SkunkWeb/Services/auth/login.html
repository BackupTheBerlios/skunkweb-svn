   What to do if the username/password combo is bogus, or potentially,
   they actually plan to use username & password as arguments to the
   page that we interrupted.  Probably should just do what you'd
   normally do (i.e. show the form) and let them know they messed up.
   It should also make sure to preserve the vals argument (see below)
   so that if/when the eventually do manage to log in successfully,
   everything works as it should.

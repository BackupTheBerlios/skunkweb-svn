"""
This module provides "timezone" objects 
which the Date module can use
when converting DateTime objects from one
time zone to another.

Timezone objects are used by Date.Convert 
to convert date/times between different timezones on Earth. 
Computers have had many different ways to specify 
timezone values; our Date module tries to 
accommodate them all.

First of all, let's start with the simplest 
kind of timezone, the offset: a number of 
hours/minutes ahead or behind of Universal Coordinated Time 
(UTC/GMT). These kinds of timezones are specified as strings, 
with the number of hours-then-minutes and a "-" for behind 
of UTC and a "+" (or nothing) for ahead of UTC:

"-0400" - 4 hours behind UTC
"+0100" - 1 hour ahead of UTC
"0230" - 2 hours, 30 minutes ahead of UTC
"-0000" or "+0000" - UTC

You can use strings like this with 
Date.Convert:

Date.Convert(date, to_zone="-0400", from_zone="-0000")

will add four hours to the DateTime object you pass in.

The other kind of timezone is the timezone object. 
It's not just an offset from UTC; it represents a set 
of rules on when to use daylight saving time and when not 
to use it. These timezones are actually Python objects, 
with methods available to determine if a date/time 
is in daylight savings or not, etc.

These timezone objects can be used directly, but it's more
common to specify them to Date.Convert by their name 
strings. A timezone object has many name strings, which
try to provide easy and expected names for the timezone
in all of the languages and naming systems we use. For example,
the timezone object for United States Eastern Time can be
identified by the following names:

'ET'
'Eastern'
'US/Eastern'
'USA Eastern'
'EEUU Este' 
'EUA Leste'
'us.fl'
'us.ny'

There is one "special" timezone name, and that is "LOCAL". 
If you specify the string "LOCAL" as the timezone, 
the Date module takes that to mean the machine's local 
timezone. (This may not be the same as your own personal 
local timezone, so be aware of which timezone your 
machine is set to.) "LOCAL" identifies a special LocalTimezone
object in the Timezone module, which handles conversions
gracefully to and from local machine time.

Daylight Savings Time

This module's timezone objects do support daylight savings
time, with some important restrictions. Daylight savings "rules"
are implemented in each TimezoneDST object, but there's only one set
of rules in each object, the most recent rules adopted by the timezone.
In the United States, the rules have been the same since the 1960s;
so the US-based timezone objects will handle daylight savings correctly
for any DateTime objects more recent than 1960 or so. Other timezones
have made recent changes to their rules or, worse yet, they change
their rules every year!

What this means to you, the practical programmer, is that 
this module guarantees correct daylight savings behavior only
for the current date/time on the machine. For other times, correct
behavior depends on when the timezone's rules have changed. Here is
a short guide to "daylight savings dependability" for different timezones:

USA timezones: all dates from Jan 1, 1970
Mexico timezones: all dates from Jan 1, 1990
Brazil timezones: all dates from Jan 1, 1998
Other Latin American timezones: all dates from Jan 1, 2000

# "offset" handling functions
#
# offsets are the strings like "-0400" that are used
# in ISO date formats.
#
# It's not worth making Timezone objects for these,
# so we're using a regex instead, and Convert() does
# the heavy lifting.

# Conversion function
#
# to_zone and from_zone accept either strings or 
# Timezone instances. IF strings, it checks if string
# is a GMT offset like '-0400'. If so, it handles it
# as a falt offset from GMT. If not, it looks it up
# with get_timezone(). get_timezone will throw
# a ValueError if it can't find the timezone at that point.
# 'LOCAL' will always find the special LocalTimezone object.

    and to_zone default to the local timezone.

Supported Platforms
------------------------------
SkunkWeb has is known to compile and run under the following operating
systems:
    Linux
    Solaris

It should work on any reasonable version of Unix that Python works.
It turns out that it appears to run on Windows under Cygwin.


Prerequisites
------------------------------
Python 2.1.1 or later (2.1 works but is not GPL compatible)
  optionally compiled with the crypt module
Marc Andre Lemburg's eGenix mx Extensions (BASE)
    http://www.lemburg.com/files/python/eGenix-mx-Extensions.html#mxBASE
An ANSI C compiler

Optionally install apache.  Make sure you configure it with at least:

(for Apache 1.x)
   --enable-module=so 
(for Apache 2.x)
   --enable-so

If you don't you will have a *very* bad day If you run into problems
on Apache 1.x, try configuring apache with these additional
switches:
   --disable-module=dir --disable-module=autoindex


Installation
------------------------------

Installing SkunkWeb should be rather painless since it makes use of
GNU autoconf.  Just untar and run configure.  Make sure that apache's
bin/ directory is in your path (or alternatively specify the
--with-apxs directive) if you are going to build the mod_skunkweb
Apache module. Outside of the usual configure options, the following
configure options are also available:

  --with-skunkweb       Install SkunkWeb as part of this installation 
                        (default yes)
  --with-python=/path/python   Specify path to python executable
  --with-user=user        Make Skunk installation owned by user
  --with-group=group      Make Skunk installation owned by group

Additional options if building SkunkWeb:
  --with-webdoc           Install some sample content
  --with-services=svcs    Specify the list of services to install
                           space delimited list of services to install;
                           valid names are:

                           sessionHandler, requestHandler, remote,
                           ae_component, remote_client, aecgi,
                           httpd, basicauth, pars, web, templating,
                           oracle, postgresql, mysql cookieauth
                          Default is to install them all

  --with-sudo=/path/sudo  Specify path to sudo
  --without-mod_skunkweb  Don't build mod_skunkweb
  --with-apxs=/path/apxs  Specify path to the apxs program

Once ``configure'' has completed, simply type ``make; make install''.


Building the Documentation
------------------------------
In most cases you probably want to grab the docs from the SkunkWeb
website (http://skunkweb.sourceforge.net/docs.html), but if you want
to build them yourself, here's how:

If you've ever built the Python documentation from source, SkunkWeb's
is built pretty much the same way.

What you need:
   1) A working LaTeX2e installation (PDFLaTeX if you want PDF output)
   2) LaTeX2HTML 2K.1beta (1.47) if you want to build the HTML docs
      --other versions may work, but I've heard there may be problems.

There are three directories that correspond to the output type:
  html           HTML output  
  paper-letter   Paper formats (PS, DVI, PDF) for letter sized paper
  paper-a4       Paper formats (PS, DVI, PDF) for A4 sized paper

For HTML
----------
Go to the docs/html and type:
	make <docname>/<docname>.html
Where <docname> is one of:
     devel - the developer's manual
     opman - the operations (installation/care and feeding) manual
     stmlrefer - the STML reference manual

For Paper formats
--------------------
Go to either docs/paper-letter or docs/paper-a4 depending on what size
paper you're shooting for.  Then type:
	make <docname>/<docname>.<ext>
Where <docname> is as in HTML way, and <ext> is one of ps, pdf or dvi,
depending, of course on what format you want it in.

Needed now:

  * mysql needs type wrapper converters, test improvements
  * docs -- discuss type wrappers, arrayfetch (when it is ready).
  * tests: many more.  creating PyDO classes within the test might
       be a good idea in many cases.

2nd priority:

  * joins could use additional parameters so you could add to the
    where clause, and order, offset, limit.
  * array fetch (preliminary version done, needs some way of
    specifying joins other than literal sql, and dealing with all-null
    objects).

Other databases to support (eventually):
  * firebird
  * sqlrelay 
  * gadfly (does anyone use this?)
  * maxdb
  * odbc bindings (mxODBC; Drew's pure python version?) 
  * oracle (which adapter?)
  * sybase

Deferred goals:
  * introspection (especially, what are the columns of a table?) 
    and hence, generating CREATE TABLE statements (not a huge priority of
    mine, but someone might use it).

1) Marcos Sánchez Provencio <rapto@arrakis.es> asked:  
  I think that the closest project to skunkweb is webware. They seem to
  share objectives. Is it not possible to join them? What are the
  important differences between them?

Yes, they definitely do share objectives, but they differ in many ways
as to the approach:

 * WebWare uses a threaded model.  While in some ways makes things
   simpler, it makes many things more complicated.  Also, because of
   the Python global interpreter lock, if you have more than 1 CPU,
   WebWare won't actually use very much, if any of the additional CPUs
   since only one thread can run at a time.  SkunkWeb uses a forking
   process model, which makes resource sharing more complicated in
   certain circumstances, it will fully utilize all available
   processors, so SkunkWeb scales better.  It also makes reliability
   simpler, since if you screw up in one process, it won't kill the
   whole server.  OTOH, this makes it probably not run on Windows, but
   it may run under Windows with the Cygwin toolkit.  Besides, windows
   has enough problems.

 * Caching.  WebWare doesn't have any built in output cache mechanism.

 * Internationalization.  I don't believe that WebWare has any builtin
   support for message catalogs and the like.

 * Web Components.  SkunkWeb encourages the componentization of your web
   pages through caching and the like.  It can also call components on
   other SkunkWeb servers if you set it up to do so.

I guess that's the short list.  If you run latex on the SkunkIPC10.tex
file (a paper I hope to give at the February conference) in the docs
directory, that goes into a bit more detail.

2) What's the difference between SkunkWeb and Zope?

 * Like WebWare, Zope uses a threaded model instead of a forking
   model, so it has many of the same issues there.
 
 * DTML bites.  It hits on making it easy to do easy things, but is
   too constraining for the expert because you don't have the full
   flexibility of Python in the tags.  I know that they are working on
   another templating language (ZPT if I'm correct), but from what
   I've seen, it too misses the mark.

 * ZODB is the filesystem.  Many people have written about how having
   the templates in the ZODB instead of a filesystem can be a pain
   because you can't use all of your usual filesystem
   tools/editors/etc. so I won't go into too much detail on it.

 * Zope has a whole web-based content management system.  Again, for
   the less experienced, this is a plus, but if you are dealing with
   people that are more than just newbies, this can be quite a royal
   pain.  

 * To call arbitrary code from Zope templates, you have to create
   Python Method objects, which let's be honest, is a pain.  STML has
   an import tag which allows you to just get to work.

 * Internationalization.  I don't believe that Zope has any builtin
   support for message catalogs and the like.

 * http://zope-is-evil-666.idyll.org/

 * http://www.amk.ca/python/writing/why-not-zope.html

 * http://pywx.idyll.org/advocacy/why-not-zope.html

Again, the SkunkWebIPC10.tex file in the docs directory goes into this
stuff in greater detail.

How does it compare to Mason?

Mason and SkunkWeb compare rather well with each other, as they do tend 
to attack the web serving problem in similar ways

 * Mason and SkunkWeb have a similar approach to their templating languages,
   but I don't think you can reasonably extend Mason's whereby SkunkWeb's
   templating language was designed to be extendable.

 * Mason and SkunkWeb both have HTML and data components.

 * Mason and SkunkWeb both have a Request object (though SkunkWeb calls
   it CONNECTION).

 * Mason uses Perl, SkunkWeb uses Python.

 * Mason runs in-process with Apache (under mod_perl), SkunkWeb is
   it's own daemon (Apache talks to the daemon either by mod_skunkweb
   or by a CGI) and if you like, can serve HTTP itself directly.
   Mason's approach can easily use more memory and database resources
   that the standalone daemon model if you are talking to slow web
   connections (which you generally are) since the time it takes to
   send the page is much more than it takes to render the page.  In
   this case, you have a bunch of processes with Mason in memory and
   database connections open that are sitting idle waiting for the
   client to get the data, whereby with SkunkWeb, as soon as Apache
   gets the response back from SkunkWeb, the SkunkWeb daemon can start
   handling another request while the Apache process goes about
   sending the page back to the slow client.  As an example, with
   SkunkWeb, you may have 100 Apache processes (not even necessarily
   on the same machine mind you) using only maybe 30 SkunkWeb
   processes.  The other thing, since Apache's process pool grows and
   shrinks over time, you a) have less control over memory
   utilization, and b) you tend to reconnect to the database more
   frequently.

 * It doesn't appear that you can make custom url schemes with Mason
   without writing an Apache module to do it.  In SkunkWeb, you can
   write a Service which does it.  As an example, for my current
   employer, we have a url translation scheme which translates urls to
   and from Spanish and Portugese.

 * Internationalization.  Mason appears not to have any builtin
   internationalization features.  SkunkWeb has message catalogs.

 * Caching.  Mason caches component output to DBM whereby SkunkWeb
   caches to disk files.  SkunkWeb's cache can be shared between
   machines as well as managed with filesystem tools.  SkunkWeb's
   caching interface is also a lot easier to use.

 * Caching again.  Since you can't get at the compiled representation
   of Perl code, you can't cache the compiled forms of things in
   Mason.  In SkunkWeb, the templating language is compiled down to
   Python bytecode and cached to disk.  Compiled forms of Python
   components and message catalogs are also cached to disk.  The
   compile cache can also be additionaly stored in memory (as a
   read-through, write-through cache).

4) Paul Rubin <phr-n2001@nightsong.com> asks:
Can you add a SkunkWeb-PHP comparison to your FAQ?

 * PHP has it's own language, whereby SkunkWeb uses Python

 * PHP runs under mod_php (see the 5th bullet point for Mason).

 * PHP's database connections are not automatically rolled back at the
   end of a page.

 * PHP doesn't appear to have any builtin caching facilities except via
   user sessions.

 * It doesn't appear that you can make custom url schemes with PHP
   without writing an Apache module to do it.  In SkunkWeb, you can
   write a Service which does it.  As an example, for my current
   employer, we have a url translation scheme which translates urls to
   and from Spanish and Portugese.

 * Internationalization.  PHP appears not to have any builtin
   internationalization features.  SkunkWeb has message catalogs.

 * PHP only supports one kind of page language whereby SkunkWeb currently
   supports two (Python and STML) and could support more (an ASP-style
   templating language comes to mind).

That sounds like that's what is happening.  The solution is a scoping
directive in sw.conf:

Scope(Location("/nointerp.html", interpretMimeTypes=[]))

Where /nointerp.html is a document (or a directory name, whatever) you
don't want interpreted.  You could do this for an entire tree if you
wanted also.

I've not actually run this, so I'm not positive it works, but it should:

from SkunkWeb import Configuration
print Configuration.documentRoot # or whatever you want to do here.

7) How do you run CGIs and SkunkWeb with mod_skunkweb in the same
server or virtual host? SkunkWebExclude doesn't work!

If you set the skunkweb-handler for the root directory / and want
/cgi-bin/ to serve cgi's as normal (meaning most likely that you have
the directive ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/ , or
something like it, in httpd.conf), one might think that using
mod_skunkweb's SkunkWebExclude directive (thus: SkunkWebExclude
/cgi-bin/) might work. Unfortunately, this configuration results in
the cgis being handled by the default handler, which is nasty. This,
however, does the trick:

<Location />
SetHandler skunkweb-handler
</Location>
<Location /cgi-bin/>
SetHandler cgi-script
</Location>

"""
This module implements the back-end details of "basic" 
authentication as used by many HTTP servers 
(and, actually, Unix logins).

Basic authentication consists of accepting a submitted 
username and password and comparing it to a username/password
pair stored by some device. On the surface, pretty basic,
right?

This module provides classes which can be the building blocks
for your own authentication objects, which could use
a variety of sources to store the username/password pairs.
See the DictAuthenticator and Cryptor classes for details.

This module also implements a fully functional, usable class
called CryptedFileAuthenticator, which will perform
authentication against Apache "htpasswd" files and even
Unix passwd files...

The biggest caveat: To use the CryptedFileAuthenticator, you 
must have your Python interpreter built with
the crypt module. It's not installed by default,
so you will have to hack around in the Python source
and re-install, or verify that your binary installation
does include the crypt module. If you don't want to use
crypt, you can use the other contents of this module
without a hitch.

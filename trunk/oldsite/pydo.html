<h2>What is PyDO?</h2>
PyDO is a Object-Relational database access tool.  Unlike many other O-R
database access tools, PyDO:
<ul>
<li> doesn't constrain your schema to what it thinks databases should
look like 

<li> if you need/want to override the way it does it's work, it's not
a major surgical effort

<li> has tools that will, given a database connection (for Oracle and
PostgreSQL anyway) can do a lot of the work for you in writing your
data classes

<li> like any good tool, makes the easy stuff a no-brainer and makes 
the harder things easier too

<li> works with more than one database (currently Oracle, PostgreSQL
and MySQL, but others are definitely possible)

<li> is easy to figure out how it works and when it does things so that
you won't piss off your DB admin.
</ul>

	* TODO: minor updates

	* ParGenGrammar.py: regenerated

	* Parser.py: now uses CONSTANTS

	* initParGenGrammar.py: changed ruleSet from tuple to list

	* Common.py, LR0.py, LR1.py: now uses CONSTANTS

	* EBNFParse.py: minor debug change

	* EBNFGrammar.py: regenerated

	* CONSTANTS.py: New file.

	* EBNFParse.py: fiddling with a more efficient dup _temp rule reducer
	Seems to work so far -- works with oql grammar (but I doubt it
	removes many dup rules), actually it doesn't remove any since no
	dups are generated from EBNF->BNF conversion, but the python grammar
	(which does generate dups) seems ok with the new one since at least 
	the rule counts match.

	* pargen: added -D and -d options

	* pargen: added -R option
	renamed -S option to -I

	* RuleItems.py: added some diagnostics for when things go haywire

	* ebnftest2.y, ebnftest3.y, ebnftest4.y: New file.

	* EBNFParse.py: think I got thing working correctly now

	* EBNFGrammar.py, EBNFGrammar.y:
	think I got the precedence of | correct without screwing
	up the rest of the language

	* pargen: added ebnf'ability and status messages

	* Parser.py: added status messages
	added a EBNFcallback baseclass
	added an error message if things get weird

	* EBNFParse.py: should now totally work!

	* GrammarLoader.py: added status message

	* EBNFGrammar.py: rebuilt

	* EBNFGrammar.y: fixed it so the alternate (|) functionality works

	* CompileGrammar.py: added status messages

1999-11-05  drew@naxos.skunk.org  <drew@naxos.skunk.org>

	* ParGenGrammar.py: rerun through pargen

	* EBNFGrammar.py, EBNFGrammar.y, EBNFLex.py, EBNFParse.py, ebnftest.y:
	New file.

	* CompileGrammar.py:
	now that I've given up the cool way to do LALR, we do it slightly more
	efficiently

	* Common.py: made it so it doesn't add $ to the list of terminals

	* LALR.py:
	got a version that does LALR somewhat via LR1 but doesn't generate the whole
	set of LR1 items.

	* test4.py: New file.

1999-11-04  drew@naxos.skunk.org  <drew@naxos.skunk.org>

	* fnci: now ignores emacs auto-save files

	* LALR.py:
	still fucking with it... It seems to generate the lookaheads properly
	though.  Just won't generate the state/goto tables

	* Common.py: finally think I got FIRST and FIRSTS working properly

	* CompileGrammar.py: changed call for LALR0

	* fnci: commented out a debug echo

	* pargen: separated grammar loading into separate module

	* GrammarLoader.py: New file.

1999-11-03  drew@naxos.skunk.org  <drew@naxos.skunk.org>

	* ChangeLog:
	fixed since doing more than one vc-update-changelog can fuck you

	* ChangeLog: New file.

	* TODO: added more shit

	* test2.py: minor mods

	* fnci, __init__.py, TODO, ParGenGrammar.y: New file.

	* LR1.py: minor cleanup

	* LALR.py: still trying to fix this damn thing

	* CompileGrammar.py: now calls LALR.generateStateTable for LALR0

	* Common.py: for FIRST, if None in FIRST, remove None, add $
	initialized terminals with $

	* pargen: updated help

	* LALR.py:
	fucking around with it since it still don't work (but LR(1) - > LALR(1)  does)

	* CompileGrammar.py:
	updated for new interface to LR1.generateStateTable

	* pargen: New file.

	* RuleItems.py: added a __getitem__ method to Set

	utilize the new __getitem__ method in __str__ method of Item

	* LR1.py:
	since Set has __getitem__ and addSet methods now, cleaned up situations
	where we had to use .items and .addList

	for some reason I was iterating over range(len(C)) and using the index only
	to get C[i].  fixed.

	cleaned up conflict detection code

	* LR0.py:
	a few cleanups, mainly to clean up the conflict detection code

	* LALR.py: fixed canonicalLRToLALR so it:
		1) works
		2) is much neater
		3) is much easier to understand

	* CompileGrammar.py:
	have the indexFunc for determining the goto state index as a passed in
	parameter since LALR1 and LR1 need to do it differently
	specifically LR1 needs to check lookaheads where LALR1 doesn't

	* Common.py: fixed FIRSTS function so it actually works now

1999-11-02  drew@naxos.skunk.org  <drew@naxos.skunk.org>

	* LR1.py, LR0.py, LALR.py: lotso comments

	* RuleItems.py: added comment

	* testgrammar.y, Common.py, CompileGrammar.py, LALR.py, LR0.py, LR1.py, ParGenGrammar.py, ParGenLex.py, Parser.py, RuleItems.py, initParGenGrammar.py, test.py, test2.py:

PyDO is a ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) database access library for
Python that facilitates writing a Python database access layer.  PyDO
attempts to be simple, flexible, extensible, and unconstraining.

PyDO was originally written by Drew Csillag in 2000, with
contributions and maintainance by Jacob Smullyan and others (see
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS), and was released as part of the SkunkWeb_ web
application server.  The 2.0 series is a fairly far-reaching overhaul
of the codebase undertaken by JS.  (The old PyDO version is still
available in SkunkWeb 3.4.0.)

The previous version of PyDO supported PostgreSQL with three different
database adapters, Mysql, SapDB, Sqlite, and Oracle.  The 2.0 series
currently supports PostgreSQL (with the psycopg driver), Mysql,
Sqlite, Oracle (with the cx_oracle driver) and MS SQLServer (with the
adodbapi driver); support for other database systems is planned.

PyDO 2 has several enhancements:

   * PyDO can now be used in multi-threaded or twisted-style
     asynchronous sitations, with or without a customizable connection
     pool.

   * PyDO objects are now dict subclasses, but also support attribute
     access to fields.

   * Projections -- subsets of the field list of a super-class -- are
     now supported by the PyDO.project() method.

   * PyDO classes can now introspect into the database at runtime to
     obtain field information.

   * Overall, the API has been tightened and the code restructured.

PyDO 2 requires Python 2.4 or later.

More documentation is available in the doc/ subdirectory of the PyDO
distribution:  

    * the PyDO manual (manual.rst)
    * epydoc-generated API documentation (in api/html)

Questions about PyDO can be raised on the `SkunkWeb mailing list`_.

PyDO is a ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) database access tool for
Python that facilitates writing a Python database access layer.  PyDO
attempts to be simple, flexible, extensible, and unconstraining.

PyDO was originally written by Drew Csillag in 2000, with
contributions and maintainance by Jacob Smullyan and others (see
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS), and was released as part of the SkunkWeb web
application server.  The 2.0 series is a fairly far-reaching overhaul
of the codebase undertaken by JS.  (The old PyDO version is still
available in SkunkWeb 3.4.0.)

The previous version of PyDO supported PostgreSQL with three different
database adapters, Mysql, SapDB, Firebird, Sqlite, and Oracle.  The
2.0 series currently supports only PostgreSQL (with the psycopg
driver), Mysql, and Sqlite, but support for other database systems is
planned.

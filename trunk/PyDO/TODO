  * drivers (no new ones for first release)
    - mysql needs type wrapper converters, connection cache, test improvements
  * connection caching and pooling -- test, refine
  * docs
  * tests
  * first release

Other new features:
  * introspection (especially, what are the columns of a table?) -- DEFER
    and hence, generating CREATE TABLE statements (not a huge priority of
    mine, but someone might use it). -- DEFER
  * joins could use additional parameters so you could add to the
    where clause. (?)
  * more general version of scatter fetch (a query on multiple tables/projections). -- YES

Target for first alpha:
  * fix mysql; better support for autocommit.
  * pool should work; if cache isn't declared, what happens?
  * tests should have better coverage!!!
  * docs should be almost complete!!!

Other databases to support:
  * firebird
  * sqlrelay (I'm particularly interested in this!)
  * gadfly (does anyone use this?)
  * maxdb
  * odbc bindings (mxODBC; Drew's pure python version?) 
  * oracle (which adapter?)
  * sybase


NOTES
-----

In the case of postgresql, it should usually be possible to determine
what sequence is being used by guessing, or by introspection.  

--

I've refactored the inheritance semantics; this needs to be documented
and tests added.

-- 

I'm using Python 2.4 constructs now -- decorators and generator
expressions.

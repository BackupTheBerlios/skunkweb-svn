Needed now:

  * mysql needs type wrapper converters, test improvements
  * docs -- discuss type wrappers, joins and arrayfetch (when it is ready).
  * tests: many more.  creating PyDO classes within the test might
       be a good idea in many cases.

2nd priority:

  * fix array fetch and add it to joins module.
  * make joins work with self-joins and nested joins.

Other databases to support (eventually):
  * firebird
  * sqlrelay 
  * gadfly (does anyone use this?)
  * maxdb
  * odbc bindings (mxODBC; Drew's pure python version?) 
  * oracle (which adapter?)
  * sybase

Deferred goals:
  * introspection (especially, what are the columns of a table?) 
    and hence, generating CREATE TABLE statements (not a huge priority of
    mine, but someone might use it).

Todo for 1.0:
  * more tests, bugfixes
  * Oracle introspection?

Todo for 1.1:
  * iterSome, iterfetch (may require Python 2.5 implementing PEP 342,
    as resource cleanup needs to be done when a generator yielding
    results is gced).  These would be generator methods, yielding
    result rows rather than returning a list (like getSome and fetch
    do).  

  * refactor drivers so that db-specific stuff is separated from dbapi 
    driver specific stuff; individual drivers would be mixins of one
    of each.  This would be particularly useful for sqlrelay and odbc;
    also it would make supporting multiple postgresql/oracle db api
    drivers easier. 


  
Other databases to support (eventually):
  * firebird
  * sqlrelay 
  * maxdb
  * gadfly (does anyone use this?)
  * odbc bindings (mxODBC; Drew's pure python version?) 
  * oracle -- in progress
  * ingres
  * sybase
  * db2

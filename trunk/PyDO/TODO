  * mysql needs type wrapper converters, connection pool, test improvements
  * docs -- joins, complete example, type wrappers.
  * tests: many more.  creating PyDO classes within the test might
       be a good idea in many cases.
  * first release - by the 20th.

Other new features:
  * introspection (especially, what are the columns of a table?) -- DEFER
    and hence, generating CREATE TABLE statements (not a huge priority of
    mine, but someone might use it). -- DEFER
  * joins could use additional parameters so you could add to the
    where clause. (?)
  * array fetch (preliminary version done).

Target for first alpha:
  * fix mysql; better support for autocommit.
  * pool should work; if cache isn't declared, what happens?
  * tests should have better coverage!!!
  * docs should be almost complete!!!

Other databases to support:
  * firebird
  * sqlrelay (I'm particularly interested in this!)
  * gadfly (does anyone use this?)
  * maxdb
  * odbc bindings (mxODBC; Drew's pure python version?) 
  * oracle (which adapter?)
  * sybase


NOTES
-----

In the case of postgresql, it should usually be possible to determine
what sequence is being used by guessing, or by introspection.  Is this
worth doing?

--

I've refactored and documented the inheritance semantics; tests still
needed.

-- 

I'm using Python 2.4 constructs now -- decorators and generator
expressions.

--

I've added "arrayfetch", but have no special syntax yet for expressing
joins or dealing with NULLs.

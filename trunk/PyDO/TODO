  * drivers
  * connection caching and pooling
  * docs
  * tests
  * first release

Other new features:
  * introspection (especially, what are the columns of a table?)
    and hence, generating CREATE TABLE statements (not a huge priority of
    mine, but someone might use it). -- DEFER
  * joins could use additional parameters so you could add to the
    where clause. (?)
  * more general version of scatter fetch (a query on multiple tables/projections).

NOTES
-----

In the case of postgresql, it should usually be possible to determine
what sequence is being used by guessing, or by introspection.  

-- 

Any table without a unique constraint is immutable.  Any mutation of
an instance now checks _unique.

---

Figure out where typewrappers are dealt with.  Clearly they are driver
dependent; can some of the work be done in the generic converter?

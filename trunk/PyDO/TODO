Todo:
  * some sort of validation framework.
  * mysql needs type wrapper converters, test improvements
  * tests: many more.  creating PyDO classes within the test might
       be a good idea in many cases.
  * genscripts -- generate modules with classes for every table.  
    (guess relations?)
  * make it easy to cache the results of table introspection

Other databases to support (eventually):
  * firebird
  * sqlrelay 
  * maxdb
  * gadfly (does anyone use this?)
  * odbc bindings (mxODBC; Drew's pure python version?) 
  * oracle -- in progress
  * ingres
  * sybase
  * db2

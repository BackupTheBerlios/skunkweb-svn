Todo:
  * make joins work with self-joins and nested joins.
  * some sort of validation framework.
  * mysql needs type wrapper converters, test improvements
  * tests: many more.  creating PyDO classes within the test might
       be a good idea in many cases.
  * genscripts -- generate modules with classes for every table.  
    (guess relations?)
 
Done:
  * fix array fetch
  * set a default field class, so custom field classes can be
    specified with tuple notation if desired 
  * introspection (especially, what are the columns of a table?) 

Other databases to support (eventually):
  * firebird
  * sqlrelay 
  * maxdb
  * gadfly (does anyone use this?)
  * odbc bindings (mxODBC; Drew's pure python version?) 
  * oracle (which adapter?)
  * ingres
  * sybase
  * db2

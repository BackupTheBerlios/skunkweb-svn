2005-05-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/log.py (logger): another Jonathan Ellis patch: adding
	default handler to logger.

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/psycopgconn.py (PsycopgDBI.describeTable):
	from patch by Jonathan Ellis, implementation of describeTable().

	* src/PyDO2/dbi.py (DBIBase.describeTable): docstring patch
	from Jonathan Ellis (lightly edited) documenting his change to the
	return value of this function.

2005-05-12  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/__init__.py (__version__): upping to 2.0a2.

2005-05-12  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO.project): projections with schemas were
	broken (the schema got added twice).  Fixed.
	(PyDO.getTable): now takes a withSchema parameter, defaulting to
	True (useful for projection fix).

2005-05-11  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: document PyDO._create_field.

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO.newfetch, PyDO.newnofetch): brown bag
	typo fix: was missing @classmethod for these two methods, which
	hence did not work.
	(PyDO._create_field): now delegate Field instance creation in the
	metaclass to a static method in PyDO.

2005-05-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/examples/pim.py: removed refetchs and table attributes,
	added a couple of comments.
	
2005-05-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* setup.py (classifiers): little improvements to setup.py.

2005-05-09  Jacob Smullyan <smulloni@smullyan.org>
	* cut release PyDO-2.0a1.

2005-05-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO._joinTableSQL): fixed to use getTable().
	(PyDO): now support schema name in a separate schema attribute,
	and permit table name to be guessed from class name if
	_guess_tablename is True (as it is by default).
	(PyDO.new): moved the implementation of new to a new method, _new,
	which moves fieldData from kwargs to a dictionary.  The only
	reason to do this is that someone might have a column called
	'refetch'. (PyDO.project): fix to pass the table name to
	projections, in case the table attribute doesn't contain it.

	* src/PyDO2/__init__.py (__version__): bumped version to alpha 1.

	* doc/manual.rst: now mentions "newfetch" and auto-guessing.
	* src/PyDO2/base.py: adding new method, "newfetch" (equivalent to
	calling new() with refetch=1) and "newnofetch".  Also, fixes some
	bugs with getUnique(). 

2005-05-05  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>	
	 
	* (many files): renamed package from PyDO to PyDO2.

2005-04-08  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: an example used "!=%s" with a bind variable of
	None; but that is bad sql ("!=NULL" rather than "IS NOT NULL").
	So I changed None to an empty string.

2005-03-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: fixed inaccuracy in describing what input
	getUnique() tolerates.

	* src/PyDO/drivers/mysqlconn.py: adding stub implementation of
	typewrapper conversion for mysql, pending testing.

2005-03-20  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/base.py (__all__): adding arrayfetch.

2005-03-20  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: document the Join classes and arrayfetch.

2005-03-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/joins.py: curried the Join class with a slew of subclasses. 

2005-03-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/joins.py (Join.getSome): reimplemented a bit.  Still
	doesn't work with nested joins or self-joins.

2005-03-18  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/joins.py: starting work on module that does various
	types of joins.  Doesn't work yet.

2005-03-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/utils.py: moved some utility functions to a separate
	module. 

	* src/PyDO/base.py (PyDO.getColumns): change to behavior, and
	method signature (optional parameter is now "qualifier", not
	"qualified").  If qualifier is a string, it will be used as the
	table alias; if it isn't and is true, the full table name will be
	used. 

2005-03-16  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/base.py (_metapydo.__init__): removed unnecessary
	dict() around generator expression passed to update().
	(PyDO.joinTable): now it is possible to add to the where clause, a
	la getSome(), including order, limit, and offset, and add extra
	tables to the select as well.
	(arrayfetch): put in None rather than a PyDO object when all the
	columns are null for an object.  This method, however, is probably
	going bye-bye, to be replaced by a happy little family of Join
	objects. 

2005-03-15  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/base.py (_setize): removed spurious variable
	assignments (left in by mistake).

2005-03-15  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/__init__.py (__version__): cutting first alpha release (2.0a0).

	* src/PyDO/drivers/psycopgconn.py (_converters): support for type
	wrappers for postgresql.

2005-02-22  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@bunbury.smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/field.py: dropped "attrs" parameter for fields; to
	associate additional information with fields, use a subclass.
	(Arguably I should drop dbtype and nullable -- which I just added
	--, too.)

	* src/PyDO/{pydo,field}.py: more refactoring: eliminated the
	sequenced class attribute, and now declare sequences, and most
	unique constraints, inside fields.  Two new Field subclasses,
	Sequence and Unique, take care of this.

	* src/PyDO/{pydo,dbi}.py: refactoring underway.  auto_increment is
	now combined with sequenced, and the driver decides whether it is
	really auto-increment or not (not a hard decision, since dbs all
	seem to do either one or the other).  Also, found a bug in which
	the public class attributes in PyDO, "unique" and "sequenced",
	were being inherited twice, in the case of projections,
	incorrectly.

	* src/PyDO/pydo.py (PyDO.delete): was testing class attribute
	"unique" rather than "_unique", which was a booboo.

2005-02-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@bunbury.smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/pydo.py (PyDO.copy): removed redundant copy (as
	dict(self) already makes a dict copy).

2005-02-16  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@bunbury.smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/pydo.py (PyDO.project): implemented projections.
 
 	* tests/sqlite_test.py (SqliteTest.test_project): test for
	projections.

	* src/PyDO/operators.py (__makeOperators): removed use of
	deprecated new module; a little code tightening.

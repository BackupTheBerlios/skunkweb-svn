	* src/PyDO/base.py (_metapydo.__init__): removed unnecessary
	dict() around generator expression passed to update().
	(PyDO.joinTable): now it is possible to add to the where clause, a
	la getSome(), including order, limit, and offset, and add extra
	tables to the select as well.
	(arrayfetch): put in None rather than a PyDO object when all the
	columns are null for an object.  This method, however, is probably
	going bye-bye, to be replaced by a happy little family of Join
	objects.

	* src/PyDO/base.py (_setize): removed spurious variable
	assignments (left in by mistake).

	* src/PyDO/__init__.py (__version__): cutting first alpha release (2.0a0).

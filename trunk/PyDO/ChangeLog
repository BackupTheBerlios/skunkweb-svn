2005-05-31  Tim Golden  <mail@timgolden.me.uk>

        * src/pydo/drivers/mssqlconn.py: more precise handling of
        identity / sequence detection (only consider something as
        a sequence if it is not null, an identity and a primary key).
        Also correct a type which had the wrong sql executed when
        looking for unique constraints.

2005-05-31  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@bunbury.smullyan.org>

	* src/pydo/base.py (PyDO._update_raw): *partial* fix for bug found
	by Hamish Lawson -- the accumulation of bind variables is broken
	for parastyles that store values in a dictionary.  This fix is for
	_update_raw, but there more methods to be repaired.

	* doc/manual.rst: document the refinement in null treatment in
	fetch. 

	* src/pydo/multifetch.py (iterfetch): add a little intelligence
	about whether to map an object with all null values to None. 

	* src/pydo/base.py (arrayfetch): note in docstring that this
	function is deprecated.

	* src/pydo/joins.py: note in docstring that this module is
	deprecated. 

	* src/pydo/operators.py: removed redundancy in docstring.

	* doc/examples/pim.py: changed import here as well.

	* doc/api/Makefile (EPYDOC): change for package name.

	* doc/manual.rst: change package name, and name of fetch
	function. 

	* src/pydo/multifetch.py: renamed module again, and renamed
	scatterfetch back to fetch.  src/pydo/__init__.py: changed import
	from fetch to multifetch.

	* setup.py, tests, src/pydo: renamed package again, from PyDO2 to pydo.  
	
2005-05-30  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/fetch.py: renaming fetch to scatterfetch (fetch
	conflicts with module name); stopped flattening the resultSpec.

	* doc/manual.rst: documenting scatterfetch.

2005-05-29  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/fetch.py (iterfetch): add the columns to the column
	list in sorted order, so that if you don't use $COLUMNS you can at
	least predict what the right order is.

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO.deleteSome): fix for silly but bad bug
	reported by Steve Kieu.

	* src/PyDO2/fetch.py (fetch): remove iterfetch from __all__, and
	add great big docstring.

	* src/PyDO2/base.py: removing arrayfetch from __all__.

	* src/PyDO2/__init__.py: importing from fetch.py, and no longer
	importing from joins.py.  Also, increased version number to alpha
	3. 

	* src/PyDO2/{base,utils}.py: removing redundant util function. 

	* src/PyDO2/fetch.py: first cut at sql template
	method.

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/{psycopgconn,sqliteconn,mssqlconn}.py, 
	src/PyDO2/{base,dbi}.py: change all  str tests to basestring.

2005-05-27  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* README: adding mention of the mssql driver.

	* src/PyDO2/operators.py (CONSTANT.__init__): converting
	is-a-string tests to is-a-basestring (again, thanks to Tim
	Golden).

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/mssqlconn.py: Tim Golden's mssql driver.

	* src/PyDO2/dbi.py (_driverConfig): adding mssql driver (patch
	from Tim Golden).

2005-05-26  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/sqliteconn.py (SqliteDBI.describeTable): patch
	by Tim Golden: sqlite permits sequences to be defined as nullable,
	so don't test the nullable bit.  Also, better test for pk column
	(driver returns int in some versions, string in others).

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO._uniqueWhere): fix for bug found by Tim
	Golden (attempt to index a set).

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (_metapydo.__init__): fix for how _unique is
	built.  Uniqueness constraints created with the Unique class were
	being added improperly (a string -- the field name -- was being
	put in _unique, rather than a frozenset with one element).  

2005-05-25  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: document arrayfetch changes.

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (arrayfetch): now supports table aliases, and
	has improved signature (takes getSome()-like arguments).

	* doc/manual.rst: document the change to cls.table/getTable(), and
	changed the _guess_* attribute names.

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (_metapydo.__init__): now guess table name in
	the metaclass rather than in getTable(), so cls.table now returns
	the real table name.
	(PyDO): rename _guess_tablename and _guess_columns, removing the
	leading underscores.

2005-05-24  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/sqliteconn.py (SqliteDBI.describeTable):
	implementation added for sqlite introspection.

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (_metapydo.__init__): thinko fix: was
	discarding the values of the dictionary passed and only using the
	keys. 

2005-05-24  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: documenting _guess_columns.

2005-05-24  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/mysqlconn.py: adding implementations of
	listTables and describeTable.  

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (_metapydo.__init__): implementation of field
	guessing ('_guess_columns') that works with projections.

2005-05-23  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/dbi.py (DBIBase.describeTable): adding schema parameter.

2005-05-23  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/psycopgconn.py (PsycopgDBI.describeTable):
	made schema-aware, and raises a ValueError if there is no such
	table. 
	(PsycopgDBI.listTables): added implementation.

2005-05-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/log.py (logger): another Jonathan Ellis patch: adding
	default handler to logger.

	* src/PyDO2/drivers/psycopgconn.py (PsycopgDBI.describeTable):
	from patch by Jonathan Ellis, implementation of describeTable().

	* src/PyDO2/dbi.py (DBIBase.describeTable): docstring patch
	from Jonathan Ellis (lightly edited) documenting his change to the
	return value of this function.

2005-05-12  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/__init__.py (__version__): upping to 2.0a2.

2005-05-12  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO.project): projections with schemas were
	broken (the schema got added twice).  Fixed.
	(PyDO.getTable): now takes a withSchema parameter, defaulting to
	True (useful for projection fix).

2005-05-11  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: document PyDO._create_field.

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO.newfetch, PyDO.newnofetch): brown bag
	typo fix: was missing @classmethod for these two methods, which
	hence did not work.
	(PyDO._create_field): now delegate Field instance creation in the
	metaclass to a static method in PyDO.

2005-05-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/examples/pim.py: removed refetchs and table attributes,
	added a couple of comments.
	
2005-05-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* setup.py (classifiers): little improvements to setup.py.

2005-05-09  Jacob Smullyan <smulloni@smullyan.org>
	* cut release PyDO-2.0a1.

2005-05-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO2/base.py (PyDO._joinTableSQL): fixed to use getTable().
	(PyDO): now support schema name in a separate schema attribute,
	and permit table name to be guessed from class name if
	_guess_tablename is True (as it is by default).
	(PyDO.new): moved the implementation of new to a new method, _new,
	which moves fieldData from kwargs to a dictionary.  The only
	reason to do this is that someone might have a column called
	'refetch'. (PyDO.project): fix to pass the table name to
	projections, in case the table attribute doesn't contain it.

	* src/PyDO2/__init__.py (__version__): bumped version to alpha 1.

	* doc/manual.rst: now mentions "newfetch" and auto-guessing.
	* src/PyDO2/base.py: adding new method, "newfetch" (equivalent to
	calling new() with refetch=1) and "newnofetch".  Also, fixes some
	bugs with getUnique(). 

2005-05-05  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>	
	 
	* (many files): renamed package from PyDO to PyDO2.

2005-04-08  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: an example used "!=%s" with a bind variable of
	None; but that is bad sql ("!=NULL" rather than "IS NOT NULL").
	So I changed None to an empty string.

2005-03-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: fixed inaccuracy in describing what input
	getUnique() tolerates.

	* src/PyDO/drivers/mysqlconn.py: adding stub implementation of
	typewrapper conversion for mysql, pending testing.

2005-03-20  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/base.py (__all__): adding arrayfetch.

2005-03-20  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* doc/manual.rst: document the Join classes and arrayfetch.

2005-03-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/joins.py: curried the Join class with a slew of subclasses. 

2005-03-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/joins.py (Join.getSome): reimplemented a bit.  Still
	doesn't work with nested joins or self-joins.

2005-03-18  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/joins.py: starting work on module that does various
	types of joins.  Doesn't work yet.

2005-03-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/utils.py: moved some utility functions to a separate
	module. 

	* src/PyDO/base.py (PyDO.getColumns): change to behavior, and
	method signature (optional parameter is now "qualifier", not
	"qualified").  If qualifier is a string, it will be used as the
	table alias; if it isn't and is true, the full table name will be
	used. 

2005-03-16  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/base.py (_metapydo.__init__): removed unnecessary
	dict() around generator expression passed to update().
	(PyDO.joinTable): now it is possible to add to the where clause, a
	la getSome(), including order, limit, and offset, and add extra
	tables to the select as well.
	(arrayfetch): put in None rather than a PyDO object when all the
	columns are null for an object.  This method, however, is probably
	going bye-bye, to be replaced by a happy little family of Join
	objects. 

2005-03-15  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/base.py (_setize): removed spurious variable
	assignments (left in by mistake).

2005-03-15  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* src/PyDO/__init__.py (__version__): cutting first alpha release (2.0a0).

README.tests
++++++++++++

To run these tests, copy pydotestrc.sample to ~/.pydotestrc and edit
to taste, then run::
   
   python runtests.py -d <drivers> -t <tags>

If you don't specify a driver, it will attempt to run tests with all
drivers, skipping any that it doesn't find configuration for, even if
the tests don't require a driver.  You can leave the tag option out.

Multiple tags/drivers should be separated by spaces; so if you use
multiple tags/drivers, use quotations marks around the value::

   python runtests.py -d "mysql sqlite"

You can also specify a regular expression pattern to select tests; it
will be matched against the names of the test functions::

   python runtests.py -d sqlite -p 'base|frog'

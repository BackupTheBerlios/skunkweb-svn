ABOUT mod_skunkweb
------------------

mod_skunkweb is an Apache module for connecting apache to a backend
Python process, in particular to SkunkWeb (although other Python
programs could easily use it also).  It should work both with Apache 1
and 2.  For more details, see the SkunkWeb documentation at
http://skunkweb.org/.

<LI> What are the main differences between SkunkWeb and Webware?
<A NAME="sec1">
<P>
They definitely do share objectives, but they differ in many ways
as to tho approach:

<ul>
<li> Webware uses a threaded model.  While in some ways makes things
   simpler, it makes many things more complicated.  Also, because of
   the Python global interpreter lock, if you have more than 1 CPU,
   Webware won't actually use very much, if any of the additional CPUs
   since only one thread can run at a time.  SkunkWeb uses a forking
   process model, which makes resource sharing more complicated in
   certain circumstances, it will fully utilize all available
   processors, so SkunkWeb scales better.  It also makes reliability
   simpler, since if you screw up in one process, it won't kill the
   whole server.  OTOH, this makes it probably not run on Windows, but
   it may run under Windows with the Cygwin toolkit.  Besides, windows
   has enough problems.

<LI> Caching.  Webware does cache some stuff in memory (I believe it can
   cache output in memory, SkunkWeb caches compiled things in memory),
   but last I knew, didn't cache anything to disk.  So if you have a
   lot of "components", the output can easily consume all available
   memory.  Not only that, but if you have a bunch of machines running
   the site, with SkunkWeb, they can share the cache.  Also, with
   component caching, you have much better control as to when the
   cache for a component expires.

<LI> Templating language.  Webware uses PSP as it's sole templating language.
   While PSP is good for the experienced web developer, it's a killer if
   you have to work in an environment with less experienced people.  STML
   on the other hand, is easy for novices to learn, can almost
   entirely be ignored by the people who just do markup, and doesn't
   constrain the power users too much.  On my future feature list, PSP
   support is on there, so that people who want PSP with SkunkWeb can
   have it also.  As far as runtime overhead on STML, well, STML is
   compiled to python source, and subsequently to bytecode, so the
   overhead is minimal.

<LI> Internationalization.  I don't believe that Webware has any builtin
   support for message catalogs and the like.

<LI> Web Components.  SkunkWeb encourages the componentization of your web
   pages through caching and the like.  It can also call components on
   other SkunkWeb servers if you set it up to do so.
</ul>

I guess that's the short list.  If you run latex on the SkunkIPC10.tex
file (a paper I hope to give at the February conference) in the docs
directory, that goes into a bit more detail.

<LI> What's the difference between SkunkWeb and Zope?
<A NAME="sec2">
<P>
<ul>
<li> Like Webware, Zope uses a threaded model instead of a forking
   model, so it has many of the same issues there.
 
<li> DTML bites.  It hits on making it easy to do easy things, but is
   too constraining for the expert because you don't have the full
   flexibility of Python in the tags.  I know that they are working on
   their next templating language (ZTL if I'm correct), but from what
   I've seen, it too misses the mark.

<li> ZODB is the filesystem.  Many people have written about how having
   the templates in the ZODB instead of a filesystem can be a pain
   because you can't use all of your usual filesystem
   tools/editors/etc. so I won't go into too much detail on it.

<li> Zope has a whole web-based content management system.  Again, for
   the less experienced, this is a plus, but if you are dealing with
   people that are more than just newbies, this can be quite a royal
   pain.  

<li> Extending Zope is complicated to say the least.  SkunkWeb (like
   Webware) was designed to be easily extendible and customizable.

<li> To call arbitrary code from Zope templates, you have to create
   Python Method objects, which let's be honest, is a pain.  STML has
   an import tag which allows you to just get to work.

<li> I may be wrong on this one, but I don't think that Zope allows you
   to cache the output of a template.

<li> Internationalization.  I don't believe that Zope has any builtin
   support for message catalogs and the like.

<li> Modularity.  It's pretty difficult to pull the cool bits out of
   Zope to use outside of it.  With SkunkWeb, most of the code is in
   the pylibs directory (6500 lines SkunkWeb specific, versus 20000
   lines common code) that you can use outside the skunk framework.
</ul>

Again, the SkunkWebIPC10.tex file in the docs directory goes into this
stuff in greater detail.

<LI>How does SkunkWeb compare to Mason?
<A NAME="sec3">
<P>
Mason and SkunkWeb compare rather well with each other, as they do tend 
to attack the web serving problem in similar ways

<ul>
 <li> Mason and SkunkWeb have a similar approach to their templating languages,
   but I don't think you can reasonably extent Mason's whereby SkunkWeb's
   templating language was designed to be extendable.

 <li> Mason and SkunkWeb both have HTML and data components.

 <li> Mason and SkunkWeb both have a Request object (though SkunkWeb calls
   it CONNECTION).

 <li> Mason uses Perl, SkunkWeb uses Python.

 <li> Mason runs in-process with Apache (under mod_perl), SkunkWeb is
   it's own daemon (Apache talks to the daemon either by mod_skunkweb
   or by a CGI) and if you like, can serve HTTP itself directly.
   Mason's approach can easily use more memory and database resources
   that the standalone daemon model if you are talking to slow web
   connections (which you generally are) since the time it takes to
   send the page is much more than it takes to render the page.  In
   this case, you have a bunch of processes with Mason in memory and
   database connections open that are sitting idle waiting for the
   client to get the data, whereby with SkunkWeb, as soon as Apache
   gets the response back from SkunkWeb, the SkunkWeb daemon can start
   handling another request while the Apache process goes about
   sending the page back to the slow client.  As an example, with
   SkunkWeb, you may have 100 Apache processes (not even necessarily
   on the same machine mind you) using only maybe 30 SkunkWeb
   processes.  The other thing, since Apache's process pool grows and
   shrinks over time, you a) have less control over memory
   utilization, and b) you tend to reconnect to the database more
   frequently.

 <li> It doesn't appear that you can make custom url schemes with Mason
   without writing an Apache module to do it.  In SkunkWeb, you can
   write a Service which does it.  As an example, for my current
   employer, we have a url translation scheme which translates urls to
   and from Spanish and Portugese.

 <li> Internationalization.  Mason appears not to have any builtin
   internationalization features.  SkunkWeb has message catalogs.

 <li> Caching.  Mason caches component output to DBM whereby SkunkWeb
   caches to disk files.  SkunkWeb's cache can be shared between
   machines as well as managed with filesystem tools.  SkunkWeb's
   caching interface is also a lot easier to use.

 <li> Caching again.  Since you can't get at the compiled representation
   of Perl code, you can't cache the compiled forms of things in
   Mason.  In SkunkWeb, the templating language is compiled down to
   Python bytecode and cached to disk.  Compiled forms of Python
   components and message catalogs are also cached to disk.  The
   compile cache can also be additionaly stored in memory (as a
   read-through, write-through cache).

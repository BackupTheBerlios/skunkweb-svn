This is confusing, because I have a lot of code to refactor, and a lot
to glue together.

My most immediate need is to be able to separate out the cache,
component and templating libraries, possibly to use them with skunk3
(only because getting all of skunk4 together is too much to do).  To
do this, I need:

  * to let string components once more write to stdout (using
    thread-local thingie).

  * to use thread-local globals for all the crap that is currently put
    in a so-called "factory" in the components library.

  * to get deferred components to work (put the calls in a queue,
    possibly replace the queue in the api with a callback).

  * write a skunk3 integration service.

For skunk4, the actual server is different:

  * still uses hooks; same basic architecture of the server.
  * connection data is stored in wsgi format as a thread-local
    global.  Any CONNECTION-type object is an api that someone imports
    to access that data.  
  * the actual server instances are distinguished by their conf files; nothing
    to install.
  * mvc service built-in.

SkunkWeb 3.3
------------------------------
* testing framework built using product service (so client scripts 
  can know the location of server-side components they call)
* sapdb service, package and caching connection from PyDO
* support for running python cgis persistently, for running viewcvs, 
  mailman scripts, etc.
* make PyDO separate release use distutils also for install
* reintroduce hot-debugging as an optional configuration dependency;
  write extension module using Pyrex?
* Xitami adapter for SkunkWeb -- see webpages/xitami/index12.htm under the
  Xitami distro
* Apache Tomcat adaptor for SkunkWeb -- see jakarta-tomcat-connectors source
  (at least in 4.0.4) under jk/doc
X rewrite enhancements
X another hard look at scoping -- how are overlapping scopes handled?  Can
  the default scope directives be made more powerful?  Can the code be made
  more efficient?
? Quixote support - is it feasable given how it works?
* PSP support
* get standard directory configuration options to actually work; distributions
  for gentoo, debian, redhat.
X test userdir (I suspect scoping bug)
? DAV support built on httpd
X convert from using Makefile.pre.in to using distutils to build
  and install our C modules 
X tweak makefiles (for RPM_BUILD_ROOT) and documentation
* gallery demo: multiple directories, config file 

DOCS
* a doc on the website that tells of the protocol frontends we support --
  HTTP, FastCGI, SCGI, aecgi, and soon mod_jk and xitami and what databases 
  are supported.
* probably expand the above doc to the marketing bullet-points -- perhaps
  a whitepaper too?

Future stuff
------------------------------
* a formhandler service, to make html forms and chains thereof easier
  to manage.  Adam's formlib is a start in that direction.
* a means to pass arguments to a cachable component that do not become
  part of the cache key
* ways to get expired and rendered flags via the component tags
* fix devel doc -- remove config stuff, api only -- services and 
  what API's (hooks) they export.  How to write a service.
* separate pargen release
* separate DT release
* Patch to pydoc to allow it to handle STML
* a PSP (python server pages implementation) (I've got a really cheesy one,
  but I've got to imagine there's more to it than that).
* tags which make javascript easier to live with
* other uses for swpython
L support for BETWEEN in PYDO.operators
* an XML-RPC component handler;
    Drew:
    > Do you mean to effectively have a standard mapping from XML-RPC to the
    > docroot?
    Jacob:
    > The latter, yes, so apps other than SkunkWeb can use SW components.  And
    > just as important, so SW can make component calls to XML-RPC servers.
* remote debugging (again!);
* products:
  wiki, bulletin board, and other standard web toys (the toys themselves
  would obviously not be part of the core);
* support for chat and p2p protocols;

Unknowns
------------------------------
? make rcc's via HTTP, HTTPS and swrcs (swrc over SSL)
? add request data recording/playback extension
? single submit library (use uuid lib probably)
? add an input tag (mimicking HTMLs) which can do client-side checking via
  javascript
  - ? a way to have a form redisplay if invalid data in a field

Nopes
------------------------------
N precompiled .par files
N real static doc -- Python in a short-future will have static stuff
N CookieEncoding stuff
    * Get the _Nonce for CookieEncoding into config, error if not in config
    * change _Nonce in CookieEncoding
    * separate armoring from encoding so armoring can be done separately
  module is dead
N DCOracle merge -- no longer included in dist
N add indexing to skunkdoc
N error if numKids == 0
N make AE use ConfigLoader's Config obj
N document in templating service that it will handle files where
  mimetype, DT_REGULAR is in the excutable map
N add a superteam service

@ SkunkWeb operations and setup and hints (e.g. don't use clearCache unless
  the # of cached versions is small)
@ update/convert to latex skunk_arch
@ skunk manifesto -- that's the IPC 10 paper

DONE
------------------------------
X an authorization service that supports cookie, basic, digest,
  and pluggable authorization stores.
X a rewrite service or builtin facility) that makes url rewriting
  possible without writing a service, permits multiple rewriting
  schemes to coexist without hook function order being an issue, and
  works with scoping (perhaps a Rewrite directive for sw.conf?)
X vfs !!!
X PyDO (including operators!)
X remove pars and references to it in configure
X add favicon.ico to demo content and SkunkWeb site in general
X pluggable file retrieval system for AE (would have to rework pars)
  parfile should use relative paths, like zip; parfs should work.
X CGI adaptor (in place of mod_skunkweb, etc.)
X! configure refinements (js) 
X vfs: path translation for archive files 
X fix any references to DateTime to mx.DateTime (or handle both)
X update PyDO docs for sapdb
X update MySQL driver
X vfs: make mounts show up in directory listings for MultiFS;
  make archive fses in which archives contain only a fragment of 
  a filesystem still work
X fix so everything (including PyDO) works with Python 2.2
X product service and product packaging utility
X import hook so we can import modules from the VFS (necessary for products).
@ support for extra path info and urls with params after a semicolon
X pluggable mime-type handlers
X documentRootFS should be single FS (maybe?)
X vfs.MultiFS should support callable mounts
X product service should use dynamic mount for products, fluctuating
  depending on value of documentRoot
X add semi-autoindex functionality
X update PyDO/postconn docs about host|port thing
X update PyDO/postconn docs about SERIAL columns
X add host|port thing to pgenscript
X add host|port thing to PostgreSQL module
X add FastCGI handler
X separate PyDO release
X fix msg on swmgr start
/usr/local/skunk/lib/SkunkWeb/Server.py:79: SyntaxWarning: name 'Configuration' is assigned to before global declaration
  def reload(self):
X build docs and include in dist as opposed to building during build
  or distribute docs separately (as Python does) - distribute separately
X clean up configure.in
X real PyDO doc
X removed GNU xargs/find dependancy
X Remove GNU Install dependancy
X security audit on rcc code -- ok, I was paranoid.  It was way to easy to
  audit since there is beautifully not much there.
X make so if there are permissions problems in the docroot it gives a more
  descriptive error message.  ok, it already did give a good error... oops!
X finish rewrite of the operations manual - good enough for release anyway
X way to determine whether call to callComponent actually rendered the 
  component or it was just fetched from cache.  (expired and rendered flags)
X get release stuff figured out (tag, build doc, build tarball) and working
X make default in httpd.stub to point to the tcp port not the unix socket
X document sw.conf in the .in file
X fix install target so that it installs *all* of the sample web content
X put in descriptions of errorTemplate and notFoundTemplate into sw.conf.in
X set default of parFallthrough to 1
X make so we have an errorTemplate (similar to notFoundTemplate) that
  will be rendered in the event of an exception.
X make so if you Scope the documentRoot or parFiles that it makes sure that
  you change the compileCacheRoot in the Scope also
X make AE do memory caching properly in face of a docRoot or would that be a
  cacheRoot switch -- cacheroot is now part of memory cache key
X make sure that the pars persona does the right thing.  (instead of looping
  through the list made at server start, keep a dict of parfilename:contents
  and use Configuration.parFiles to loop
X fix the services list in SkunkWeb/configure.in
X kill off vhost -- no longer needed because of Scope decls
X undepend mmlib and shared memory debug flags
X fix <:include:>
X why skunkdoc document -- NO, skunkdoc sucks.  Mayhap some way to patch
  pydoc to handle stml stuff?
X can chuck the aed_compat service
X update/convert to latex skunkdoc -- or kill it -- KILLED
X make sure that the cacheKey module handles circular structures
  without barfing
X install par.py in bin/ (need to make a .in file for it)
X de-skundocify all python code
X fix any division that might break when PEP 238 goes into effect
X remove LoggingPolicy.txt from docs
X remove portugues.xml from docs
X remove reader_profiles.xml from docs
X fixed so makefile.pre.in reference the python in @PYTHON@, not the first
  python in $PATH
X update README
X write INSTALL (reqs -- crypt, mx.., etc.)
X make so have some form of component commenting ala skunk 2 (AE lib)
X check for mxDateTime in configure
X still need crypt module? -- not entirely, but BasicAuth.py is not totally
  functional without it.
X still need syslog module? -- NO
X add copyright notices to Makefile.in's Setup.in's and configure.in's
X prepend to all appropriate files under skunk

X make an armoring pylib to stuff things into hidden form fields that
  cannot be spoofed (similar to old CookieEncoding idea, but better)
X remove defer argument from components and have cache options be
	(no,0,false),  (yes,1,true), (defer,2), (force,3), (old,4)
X remove AED directory from root 
X check http://www.webdav.org/mod_dav/license-1.html to make sure that
  we can include the code, otherwise, ditch uuid pylib (it's not actually
  used by anything currently) -- ALL is fine, it's a BSDL 
X ditch UrlApi pylib
X make a way to see what services are loaded so you can decide what to do
  say if templating isn't (or is) loaded.
X make a remote client library
X remote debugging service
X split servicing rcc's from client
X adjust stmlref manual as necessary
    * change retain tag to hidden & update stmlrefer
    * update refs to REQUEST and RESPONSE in stmlrefer
    * update refs of AED to skunkweb in stmlrefer
    * fix code examples in stmlrefer
    * remove references to the SPI in stmlrefer
X A debugging flags mechanism, so don't have to have all debug on/off
X Remove Cookie pylib
X clean up LogObj so various ERROR, etc. prefixes are removed
X fix so AE's logging stuff uses SkunkWebs stuff
X In cases where prefixes stay (ERROR marker in sw.log), make so prefix 
  is there for every line in a log message
X add a _statDocRoot function to AE.Cache
X make so if a handler returns an HTTP response code, processing stops
X do index.html from dir/ shit (make it configurable too)
X handle dir to dir/ redirects
X add src modtime as optional argument to callComponent
X check the Protocol from --- import * re: Hooks module bullshit
X See if I can remove Logging pylib
X check that its a TemplateMimeType before doing callComponent on it
X Content-Type defaulting by the request handler 
X make so SIGINT is treated the same as SIGTERM
X add no-handler RequestHandler
X plain old non-handler for non-template shit
X make so request handler does the configuration overlay stuff (aecgiHandler)
X add more debug logging
X make server reload work
X make sure that exceptions are properly logged in the Server framework (i.e.
  Server.py, SocketMan and ProcMgr)  i.e. exceptions are never silent!
X print something to stderr/out if server startup fails
  -- even if not isatty()
X start enumeration (and documentation) of config vars
X fix ProcessMgr to log like SocketMan
X added service to allow par files (Python Archive files) to be used
  as a docroot
X add templating tags to templating service -- HTMLTags, RemoteSvcs, args and 
  Log
X handle redirect exceptions in template.Handler
X make so that ctrl-c will bring down the server properly
X finish of *'s in AE's TODO (basically, cache file versioning)
X general neatening (like Id tags, import reordering, etc.)
X do AE's generic caching API stuff mentioned as F in it's TODO file
  -- not needed since the putCachedComponent and getCachedComponent calls
     in AE.Cache do it all ready
X swpython -- make a symlink from bootloader.py to swpython.py and boing!
  you've got the ever elusive swpython (nee AEDpython)
X sql extension for oracle
X fix deferred components so they actually work
X add browser object to the Connection object
X make so header dictionaries are always properly cased
X make sure the component stack in AE is cleared at the end of a request
X should the configuration changes by path still happen if not a template
   - path config done before web.PreRequest hook
X BasicAuth service
X make so connection to apache is dropped right after response sent
X make a hook after connection obj created but before path config overlay
X move and rename mod_aecgi to mod_skunkweb into SkunkWeb directory
X move/rename/adjust/whatever contents of AED/util
X do CRLF => LF conversions in python components  
X add __all__ pseudo attribute to ConfigLoader.Config class so that Python 2.1
  from Configmodule import * will work!
X add help screen to skunkweb.py
X add help screen to swpython.py
X see if can move bulk of bootloader into SkunkWeb pkg
X make an skunkweb.py (rename remainder of bootloader to it)
X make so swpython isn't a symlink but a real program
X add MaxRequests-like thing to probably the SocketMan
X add help screen to par.py
X add help screen to htpasswd.py
X make sure documentation of DT_* stuff in ae.ltx includes DT_INCLUDE and that
  docs for callComponent describe include semantics
X add feature to unload any modules that get loaded during a request (in
  SkunkWeb.Server)
X fix so templating handler will do anything that callcomponent can handle
X fix server reload... again...
X add docs about userModuleCleanup, hideMimeTypes
X if mimetype is application/x-python, change default mimetype for execution
  to text/html
X fix so that if marshal.load? fails, we don't blow up, we just ignore
X include cachefile version # in cached component outputs
X include cachekey in cached component outputs
X check that cacheKey in pylibs/AE is installed properly on make install
X fix default log path to var/log/skunk
X fix default pid path to var/run/skunk
X check sys.paths in skunkweb and swpython
X fix skunkdoc to work with python 2.1
X fix cache reaper for new cache file format
X get configuration/build/install shit working
X check compile warnings
X Move basicauth's authenticator to pylibs
X add FallbackToCache option
X add StrictMessageCatalogs option
X add vhost service
X remove remoteAed.py module from pylibs
X add vhost stuff to devel doc
X get html and other doc building working
X remove bibliography from devel
X copy necessary bits to generate HTML docs from latex ones from Python
X make so we have an html directory in which the html docs will be built, same
  for pdf, ps, etc.
X revert component.py and make so it doesn't call Cache.*cachedcomponent
  with auxArgs
X add simple remote components
X enable arbitrary auth by hook
X add services for mysql and postgresql
X have a interp mime types style thing so that .html and .py et.al. can be
  sent w/o interpretation on a per-directory basis
X write developer docs
X make so reload tries to fire off swpython to see that the config is ok (
   bootloader probably needs a configcheck option/mode) before reloading 
   proper, if configcheck fails, log it and continue with existing config.

   By nature of the fact that swmgr starts swpython, we get this for free

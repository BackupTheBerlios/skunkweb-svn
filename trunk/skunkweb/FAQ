1) Marcos Sánchez Provencio <rapto@arrakis.es> asked:  
  I think that the closest project to skunkweb is webware. They seem to
  share objectives. Is it not possible to join them? What are the
  important differences between them?

Yes, they definitely do share objectives, but they differ in many ways
as to the approach:

 * WebWare uses a threaded model.  While in some ways this makes things
   simpler, it makes many things more complicated.  Also, because of
   the Python global interpreter lock, if you have more than 1 CPU,
   WebWare won't actually use very much, if any of the additional CPUs
   since only one thread can run at a time.  SkunkWeb uses a forking
   process model, which can make resource sharing more complicated in
   certain circumstances, but which also fully utilizes all available
   processors, so SkunkWeb scales better.  It also makes reliability
   simpler, since if you screw up in one process, it won't kill the
   whole server.  OTOH, this means it doesn't run on Windows, which
   doesn't have the fork() call (actually it has been run on Windows
   with the Cygwin toolkit, but this is nothing we actively support).
   Besides, windows has enough problems.

 * Caching.  WebWare doesn't have any built in output cache mechanism.

 * Internationalization.  I don't believe that WebWare has any builtin
   support for message catalogs and the like.

 * Web Components.  SkunkWeb encourages the componentization of your web
   pages through caching and the like.  It can also call components on
   other SkunkWeb servers if you set it up to do so.

I guess that's the short list.  If you run latex on the SkunkIPC10.tex
file in the docs directory, that goes into a bit more detail.

2) What's the difference between SkunkWeb and Zope?

 * Like WebWare, Zope uses a threaded model instead of a forking
   model, so it has many of the same issues there.
 
 * DTML bites.  It hits on making it easy to do easy things, but is
   too constraining for the expert because you don't have the full
   flexibility of Python in the tags.  I know that they are working on
   another templating language (ZPT if I'm correct), but from what
   I've seen, it too misses the mark.  [It has clear advantages for  
   web designers who wish to be able to use tools like Dreamweaver to 
   edit templates, but isn't particular easy or pleasant from the 
   programmer's point of view, IMHO. -- js]

 * ZODB is the filesystem.  Many people have written about how having
   the templates in the ZODB instead of a filesystem can be a pain
   because you can't use all of your usual filesystem
   tools/editors/etc. so I won't go into too much detail on it.  SkunkWeb 
   uses a virtual filesystem, so it can use the local file system or other 
   data stores in arbitrarily configurable combination, depending on
   your needs.

 * Zope has a whole web-based content management system.  Again, for
   the less experienced, this is a plus, but if you are dealing with
   people that are more than just newbies, this can be quite a royal
   pain.  

 * To call arbitrary code from Zope templates, you have to create
   Python Method objects, which let's be honest, is a pain.  STML has
   an import tag which allows you to just get to work.

 * SkunkWeb doesn't force programmers to accept magical implicit behaviors 
   like acquisition, as Zope does; you don't need to "drink the Kool-Aid" and
   buy into a novel and introverted programming paradigm to use SkunkWeb.

 * Internationalization.  I don't believe that Zope has any builtin
   support for message catalogs and the like.

 * http://zope-is-evil-666.idyll.org/

 * http://www.amk.ca/python/writing/why-not-zope.html

 * http://pywx.idyll.org/advocacy/why-not-zope.html

Again, the SkunkWebIPC10.tex file in the docs directory goes into this
stuff in greater detail.

3) Paul Rubin <phr-n2001@nightsong.com> Asks:
How does it compare to Mason?

Mason and SkunkWeb compare rather well with each other, as they do tend 
to attack the web serving problem in similar ways

 * Mason and SkunkWeb have a similar approach to their templating languages,
   but I don't think you can reasonably extend Mason's whereby SkunkWeb's
   templating language was designed to be extendable.

 * Mason and SkunkWeb both have HTML and data components.

 * Mason and SkunkWeb both have a Request object (though SkunkWeb calls
   it CONNECTION).

 * Mason uses Perl, SkunkWeb uses Python.

 * Mason runs in-process with Apache (under mod_perl), SkunkWeb is
   it's own daemon (Apache talks to the daemon either by mod_skunkweb
   or by a CGI) and if you like, can serve HTTP itself directly.
   Mason's approach can easily use more memory and database resources
   that the standalone daemon model if you are talking to slow web
   connections (which you generally are) since the time it takes to
   send the page is much more than it takes to render the page.  In
   this case, you have a bunch of processes with Mason in memory and
   database connections open that are sitting idle waiting for the
   client to get the data, whereby with SkunkWeb, as soon as Apache
   gets the response back from SkunkWeb, the SkunkWeb daemon can start
   handling another request while the Apache process goes about
   sending the page back to the slow client.  As an example, with
   SkunkWeb, you may have 100 Apache processes (not even necessarily
   on the same machine mind you) using only maybe 30 SkunkWeb
   processes.  The other thing, since Apache's process pool grows and
   shrinks over time, you a) have less control over memory
   utilization, and b) you tend to reconnect to the database more
   frequently.

 * It doesn't appear that you can make custom url schemes with Mason
   without writing an Apache module to do it.  In SkunkWeb, you can
   write a Service which does it.  As an example, for my current
   employer, we have a url translation scheme which translates urls to
   and from Spanish and Portugese.

 * Internationalization.  Mason appears not to have any builtin
   internationalization features.  SkunkWeb has message catalogs.

 * Caching.  Mason caches component output to DBM whereby SkunkWeb
   caches to disk files.  SkunkWeb's cache can be shared between
   machines as well as managed with filesystem tools.  SkunkWeb's
   caching interface is also a lot easier to use.

 * Caching again.  Since you can't get at the compiled representation
   of Perl code, you can't cache the compiled forms of things in
   Mason.  In SkunkWeb, the templating language is compiled down to
   Python bytecode and cached to disk.  Compiled forms of Python
   components and message catalogs are also cached to disk.  The
   compile cache can also be additionaly stored in memory (as a
   read-through, write-through cache).

4) Paul Rubin <phr-n2001@nightsong.com> asks:
Can you add a SkunkWeb-PHP comparison to your FAQ?

 * PHP has it's own language, whereby SkunkWeb uses Python

 * PHP runs under mod_php (see the 5th bullet point for Mason).

 * PHP's database connections are not automatically rolled back at the
   end of a page.

 * PHP doesn't appear to have any builtin caching facilities except via
   user sessions.

 * It doesn't appear that you can make custom url schemes with PHP
   without writing an Apache module to do it.  In SkunkWeb, you can
   write a Service which does it.  As an example, for my current
   employer, we have a url translation scheme which translates urls to
   and from Spanish and Portugese.

 * Internationalization.  PHP appears not to have any builtin
   internationalization features.  SkunkWeb has message catalogs.

 * PHP only supports one kind of page language whereby SkunkWeb currently
   supports two (Python and STML) and could support more (an ASP-style
   templating language comes to mind).

> Is there any way of allowing [some] files to be passed straight through, 
without compiling them?

One solution is a scoping directive in sw.conf (or in another file which you 
include into sw.conf through sw.conf's Include directive):

Scope(Location("/nointerp.html", interpretMimeTypes=[]))

Where /nointerp.html is a document (or a directory name, whatever) you
don't want interpreted.  You could do this for an entire tree if you
wanted also.  If you are using Apache, the SkunkWebExcludeDocs
directive can also be used to make Apache serve a tree of documents
with its default handler.

Sure.

from SkunkWeb import Configuration
doSomethingWith(Configuration.documentRoot) 

The Configuration object is generally speaking a treasure trove of
such information.  Be aware that it is a "scopeable" object, meaning
that it can be configured to return different values for different
variables depending on the request; the documentRoot, for instance,
may not always be the same, so you wouldn't want to cache any
component whose output is dependent on an internally-accessed
Configuration variable that may be scoped.  It is safer, therefore, to
pass in the value of a Configuration variable as an argument to the
component.

7) How do you run CGIs and SkunkWeb with mod_skunkweb in the same
server or virtual host? SkunkWebExclude doesn't work!

If you set the skunkweb-handler for the root directory / and want
/cgi-bin/ to serve cgi's as normal (meaning most likely that you have
the directive ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /usr/local/apache/cgi-bin/ , or
something like it, in httpd.conf), one might think that using
mod_skunkweb's SkunkWebExclude directive (thus: SkunkWebExclude
/cgi-bin/) might work. Unfortunately, this configuration results in
the cgis being handled by the default handler, which is nasty. This,
however, does the trick:

<Location />
SetHandler skunkweb-handler
</Location>
<Location /cgi-bin/>
SetHandler cgi-script
</Location>

8) My sw.conf file is unmanageable!  Can I break it up into several files?

Use the Include directive:

# in sw.conf
Include("/usr/local/skunk/etc/vhosts.conf")
Include("/usr/local/skunk/etc/rewrite.conf") # etc.

9) How do I get at what in CGI land would be PATH_INFO?

Add the rewrite service to your sw.conf services listing and 
add this:

rewriteRules=(r'(.*\..*?)(?P<pathinfo>/.*)', r'\1')

and a cgi argument (accessed via CONNECTION.args or <:args:>) named
pathinfo will contain what you want.

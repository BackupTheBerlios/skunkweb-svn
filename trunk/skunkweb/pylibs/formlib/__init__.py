# My strategy is as follows:

# first to think of what you need
# to do to create a single form,
# deal with displaying it, handling
# submissions, validating, and
# processing the individual submission,
# and then dispatching the next action.

# then think about organizing chains or
# other structures of actions.

# this is a little different than
# my previous, more top-down, approach,
# which was too heavy-handed.

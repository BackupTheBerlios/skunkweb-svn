Chapter 2: SkunkWeb Fundamentals
================================

    - Introduction
    - Using Components
   
    (This is vague right now; I think it should be of a tutorial
     nature and introduce STML as well as Python components.  A very
     simple example application wouldn't be out of place here.)
  

Chapter 3: STML Reference
===============

[This is basically an update of the earlier STML manual.  However,
since the previous chapter will be introductory, it can less chatty
than it is now.]

2002-04-29  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: removed part where you specified the password 
	slot for the PlainSessionAuth authorizer since we don't do that
	anymore.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/__init__.py: added more documentation in
	the comment describing authorizer objects as well as did a few 
	grammar/spelling/capitalization fixes.

	The SessionAuthBase also no longer stores the password in the 
	session.  That was pretty stupid.  If somebody actually wants that, 
	they can do it themselves.

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: removed cookieauth stuff, added auth stuff

	* configure, configure.in: removed cookieauth stuff, added auth stuff
	
	* SkunkWeb/configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in: removed cookieauth 
	stuff, added auth stuff

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/{login.html,__init__.py,logout.html}:
	added new auth service

	* SkunkWeb/Services/cookieauth: whole directory removed.  Superceded 
	by new auth service which is now the swiss army knife of web
	authentication.

2002-04-27  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/cookieauth/__init__.py: cleaned up so that you can provide arbitrary authenticator info that only somewhat cookie related???

2002-04-27  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/ConfigLoader.py (loadConfig): fix so that multiple config
	files/Include directive will work as promised.

	* FAQ: updated.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py (__getcompiled): now compile regexes
	in Configuration.rewriteRules, if they aren't already
	compiled. (DynamicRewriter, Redirect): extended service so it can
	perform take functions as replacements, as in re.sub, and, with
	DynamicRewriter, have access to the connection and sessionDict.
	A Redirect class added as example and trial run.

2002-04-26  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* pylibs/AE/cacheKey/cachekey.c(encodeSingle): now will encode
	DateTime objects so they can be part of a cache key, and improved the 
	error message raised when an object that cannot be used for a cache
	key component is used.

2002-04-24  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/Makefile.in: fixes so that it works with both 
	Apache 1 and Apache 2

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: now handles Apache 2!

2002-04-19  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py: A number of changes with regard to how
	datatypes, especially dates, times and intervals, are handled.
	WARNING: The interval code is unfinished.

2002-04-18  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/cookieauth/login.html: now handles invalid login 
	properly w.r.t. original query args.

	* pylibs/PyDO/pgenscript.py: applied clean up patch from Greg
	Brauer

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py (convertResultRows): fixed case problem
	in type matching

2002-04-17  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py (_isString): added support for bpchar.

2002-04-17  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* NEWS: updating for what will be 3.2.1 

	* pylibs/armor.py: added dearmor_detail so you can find out 
	where something died

	* configure, configure.in: added cookieauth stuff
	
	* SkunkWeb/configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in: added cookieauth stuff

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: added cookieauth stuff

	added cookie authentication service

2002-04-13  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: first shot towards Apache 2
	compatibility.  Doesn't compile for it yet, but it's getting there.

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py: fixed bug in scatterFetchPost when got no
	results back from the query.  Thanks to Karl Putland
	<kperacles@yahoo.com>. 

2002-04-09  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py (CachedComponent.__init__): stale was
	being set to precisely the wrong value; thanks to Stephen Coursen
	for catching this (*immediately* after the release of 3.2!)

2002-04-09  Andrew Csillag  <drew@yahoo.com>

	* SkunkWeb 3.2 cut

2002-04-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/Date/TimeUtil.py (untilString): fixes what looks like
	a cut-and-paste error that has been lurking here since 3.0.

2002-04-02  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection.extract_args): 
	fixed bug that produced UnboundLocalError in some cases

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/thumbnail.py: fixed
	dumb typo that produced NameError.

2002-03-31  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/thumbnail.py: now use
	CONNECTION.extract_args.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/pars: removing from cvs and distro.

	* SkunkWeb/configure.in, SkunkWeb/configure: remove par script,
	added productwiz.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/Makefile.in: put productwiz script in bin/.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productwiz.in: added script to start
	the product wizard, for the truly lazy.

2002-03-30  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: fixed typo in documentation of
	rewrite service, and added documentation of Include directive.

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/ConfigAdditives.py (__all__): added
	support for "from ConfigAdditives import *"; added Include
	directive

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/KickStart.py (CONFIG_STRING): now do 
	"from ConfigAdditives import *", which is now preceded by
	the import from SkunkWeb.constants (ConfigAdditives clobbers
	some of the latter)

2002-03-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES): adding Drew's new files to 
	makefile

2002-03-18  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/newsvac.comp, dcomps/newsvac.pydcmp:
	added

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/index.html, dcomps/newsforge.pydcmp:
	fixes now that newsforge and linux.com have changed a bit	

2002-03-03  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in (userModuleCleanup): this was being turned
	on in this conf file, by mistake; the default should be 0.

2002-02-24  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productwiz.py: adding a rather
	silly product-making wizard.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productmaker.py (makeProduct): fix for
	when there are no libs.

2002-02-23  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection._convertArgs):
	fix for TypeError (query.keys() when query is None)

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/manifest.py (write_manifest): some api 
	modifications for productmaker.py.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productmaker.py: so far, just a function that 
	builds a product archive; script and wizard still incomplete.

2002-02-22  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (ProductMountPoint): 
	now use dynamic mounting for product docroots.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (MultiFS): dynamic mounting
	is now possible.

	* pylibs/wizard.py: adding Rich Salz's wizard.py (version 2.0),
	with his permission.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.load): now do
	version comparisons using strnatcmp.

2002-02-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/__init__.py, 
	SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.__reallyload):
	removed reference to defaultProductLibdir and kin; corrected
	docstring some.

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/bootloader.py.in (init): for restart,
	uninstall the import hook.	

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (_keyRE): I forgot to compile this regex,
	causing an error on swmgr restart.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py: removed unnecessary
	import. 

	* pylibs/vfs/importer.py (uninstall): fixed typo; no longer
	delete __oldimport__ (leaving it around doesn't hurt).

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py (ZipFS.isdir), pylibs/vfs/tarfs.py
	(TarFS.isdir): 	no longer raise an exception when calling isdir on
	a nonexistent file. 

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.__reallyload): use
	the new vfs.importer; no longer mount the libfs on the multifs,
	since it is easier to import directly from the archive file, and
	the sys.path entry refers to the archive file fs by registered key.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (VFSRegistry, registerFS): added vfs registry,
	to support vfs urls, used by vfs.importer and product service.

	* pylibs/vfs/importer.py: totally rewritten to use Gordon
	McMillan's iu module (with his generous permission).

2002-02-20  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/ServiceRegistry.py (registerService): cosmetic
	improvements.

	* pylibs/MySQL/__init__.py (initUser): now tolerate
	calls to initUser on users who have already been initialized (the
	call then has no effect).  This fixes a problem pointed out by
	Spruce Weber with restarting the server.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/__init__.py: autocreate
	product directory.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.__reallyload):
	stopped using a vfs importer for directory products.
	(Product.load): improved dependency check -- optionally
	can include version in dependency. (Product): moved static
	methods to module methods.

	* configure.in, configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in,
	SkunkWeb/configure: added reference to product service.

2002-02-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/: adding first cut at a
	product service.  loader.py has a Product class, and loads
	products; manifest.py reads and writes manifest files.

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py (ZipFS.__init__), pylibs/vfs/tarfs.py
	(TarFS.__init__):  default value for root parameter was wrong in
	both cases; fixed.

	* pylibs/vfs/tarfs.py (TarFS.__init__): support for root
	parameter. 

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py (ZipFS.__init__): support for root
	parameter. 

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (FileNotFoundException,
	NotWriteableException): some new VFSException subclasses.	
	(FS.isWriteable): FS implementations can now declare whether
	they are writeable.  This is most useful in the cases when they
	aren't, as an fs being writeable doesn't mean that a particular
	write operation is possible.

	* pylibs/vfs/pathutil.py (Archive): added support for "root"
	parameter. 

2002-02-18  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:args:>}}):
	another LaTeX typo, grrr.

2002-02-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:args:>}}): forgot 
	an "\end{verbatim}"; fixed.

2002-02-16  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:args:>}}): added
	documentation for CONNECTION.extract_args.

	* pylibs/vfs/importer.py: still very primitive import hook for vfs.

2002-02-15  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: added rewrite documentation.

	* configure.in, configure, Skunkweb/configure.in, Skunkweb/configure: 
	added rewrite to list of services

	* FAQ: Added a faq entry about cgi directories that has been on the 
	website for some while, but which I had forgotten to put here.

2002-02-14  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py: Added Spruce Weber's rewrite service. 

	* pylibs/Authenticator.py (Authenticator.authenticate): this method
	was dying with an error whenever someone tried a username that was
	not in the auth file; fixed.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/httpd/protocol.py
	(HTTPProtocol.marshalResponse): necessary check for None.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py (requestHandler):
	removed optional logging for 404s and now log to access rather
	than error log.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection.extract_args):
	added a method that corresponds to the <:args:> tag to the
	connection object; returns a dictionary rather than automatically
	updating the local namespace.

2002-02-13  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (_processRequest): added check
	for None to prevent SW barfing on a debug statement

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py (requestHandler):
	optionally log to error log when there is a 404 (vfs error) and
	raise a 500 for other errors (which weren't supposed to occur, but
	did)

2002-02-13  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py: fix for getPathAndMinistat which broke pretty 
	much everything. 

2002-02-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/Hooks.py: moved class definitions to a pylib
	(hooks.py) 

2002-02-08  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb 3.2 beta 1 cut and PyDO 1.1 beta 1 cut

2002-02-07  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: removed references to pars, which no longer
	works; used @prefix@ instead of hard-coded /usr/local/skunk in a
	number of places; revised documentation of documentRootFS

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES): removed a directory name that
	was producing a warning during make install

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py (Configuration.documentRootFS, 
	_getPathFSAndMinistat): changed documentRootFS from a list
	to a single instance.  Add _getPathAndMinistat, since now
	it is pointless to return the fs, but left a working version
	of _getPathFSAndMinistat, now deprecated.

2002-02-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (PathPropertyStore.acquireWithAncestor): 
	snazzed up acquisition facility by delegating to this method,
	which permits one to search just a segment of a treepath, and
	specify a default or not.

2002-02-05  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/vfs/pickleProps.py: path property store that uses pickle
	files.

	* pylibs/vfs/shelfProps.py (ShelfPathPropertyStore.properties):
	removed haspath(), left in by mistake; switched from gdbm to
	bsddb. 

	* SkunkWeb/Services/sessionHandler/FSSessionStore.py
	(FSSessionStoreImpl.reapOldRecords): fixed typo that caused it to
	crash; also moved one line out of a loop. 

	* pylibs/vfs/__init__.py: made TarFS also an optional import;
	wanted to import AEPathPropertyStore, but that led to a circular
	import dependency; hmmmm.

	* pylibs/vfs/shelfProps.py, zodbProps.py: use skunklib.normpath2.

	* pylibs/skunklib/__init__.py (normpath2): added a wrapper around
	skunklib normpath that removes final slashes for those cases when
	you want that.  I should add it to the C module, to be in the
	spirit of things, eventually.

	* pylibs/vfs/aeProps.py: Added a read-only PathPropertyStore that
	uses python data components to store the properties.  You want a
	management interface? Take this!

	* pylibs/AE/Executables.py (PythonExecutable.run): indentation
	problem led to error if a data component didn't return anything

2002-02-04  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* configure.in, configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in,
	SkunkWeb.configure: remove references to pars service.	

	* pylibs/vfs/__init__.py: try to import the ZODBPathPropertyStore,
	and pass in case of error.

	* pylibs/vfs/zodbProps.py (ZODBPathPropertyStore): added
	a PathPropertyStore that uses ZODB/ZEO.

	* pylibs/vfs/shelfProps.py (ShelfPathPropertyStore): tested
	and made to work multi-process.

	* test/vfs_testsuite.py: added some tests for vfs.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (PathPropertyStore): Added new methods to
	interface, delproperty (should remove a existing property
	associated with an existing path) and acquire (walks up the
	directory tree looking for a property if not found).

2002-02-03  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* pylibs/PyDO/sapdbconn.py: minor fix from Ulrich Eck

2002-02-03  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote_client.py (getRemoteException, etc):
	revamped the remote exception generation code, taking into account
	the possibility of string exceptions

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote/test.py (runInteractive): for test
	script, added support for regular components

2002-02-01  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/sessionHandler/__init__.py (__initSession): 
	forgot to import LogObj

2002-01-29  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* pylibs/static.py: after having dropped this fix that actually
	makes this stuff work on 2.2, finally reinstated the fix because
	__call__ was being improperly handled.

2002-01-28  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* 3.2beta0 cut

2002-01-27  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py (PyDOBase.get): self.get(columnname,
	default) now returns default if self._dict[columnname]==None. 

2002-01-26  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py (_fixPath): _normpath is now applied to the
	entire resulting path, which solves a problem with zipfs.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/comp/listing.pydcmp: now
	uses the vfs.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (LocalFS.__init__): now take an argument,
	"root", which specifies the root of the fs tree.

	* pylibs/PyDO/mysqlconn.py (_dateConvertFromDB): fixed dumb goof
	-- I had thought DateTime.DateTime was a class, not a function
	that returned an instance of a type, and passed it to isinstance;
	now do a correct type check.

2002-01-25  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* Makefile.in, SkunkWeb/Makefile.in, pylibs/Makefile.in: made so
	BSD Make won't barf on them.

2002-01-23  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES): fixed typo.

2002-01-23  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* pylibs/PyDO/doc: updated MySQL documentation.

	* pylibs/vfs/pathutil.py (Archive.listdir): fixed cut-and-paste
	error.

2002-01-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES, DEMO_DIRS): fix so that the
	image gallery gets installed.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/index.html: moved
	index.html to index.inc; index.html now just consists of an
	include tag.  

	* pylibs/PyDO/operators.py (SET): added support for IN.

2002-01-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: documented Configuration.mimeHandlers.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/__init__.py (__initHooks): removed
	dumb comment.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py: Added
	Configuration.mimeHandlers, for optional mimetype-specific request
	handlers.


2002-01-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py (PyDO.static_getSome): Fixes for case when
	an empty list should be returned, and to getTupleWhere and
	getSomeWhere for cases when arguments are empty.

	* pylibs/PyDO/operators.py (tupleToSQL): Fixed nasty bug caused by
	stray colon.

	commented-out code.

2002-01-13  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/mysqlconn.py (PyDOMySQL.__unpackConnectArgs): bug
	fixes.  After doing an insert, c.fetchall() returns an empty
	sequence rather than raising an error; c.fetchone() will return
	None in that case.

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDBI.py (DBIGetConnection): Fixed some painfully
	dumb typos I introduced.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/comp/list_thumbnails.dcmp:
	Use component stack to determine the current path of this
	component, to determine where thumbnails.py is (if not given to
	the component)

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: documented new mysql service configuration
	variables, and made minor correction to description of
	sessionHandler.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/mysql/__init__.py: modified to use the newly
	refurbished MySQL pylib.

	* pylibs/MySQL/__init__.py: modified to use MySQLdb, optionally
	perform a rollback step, and optionally perform a connection
	validation check before handing out a connection.

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDBI.py (DBIGetConnection): modified to accept both
	connect strings and dictionaries of connect parameters.

	* pylibs/PyDO/mysqlconn.py: modified to use MySQLdb and take a
	dictionary of connect parameters (for interoperability with the
	MySQL pylib).


2002-01-11  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/comp/list_thumbnails.dcmp:
	use the new queryargs argument to <:img:>.

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:img:>}}): Added
	documentation of queryargs argument to <:img:> tag.
	(section{\texttt{<:include:>}}): documented the .inc and .pyinc
	extensions. 

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/HTMLTags.py (ImageTag.genCode):
	Modified <:img:> tag to take queryargs.

2002-01-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/index.html: acknowledged the
	existence of the gallery demo.

	* pylibs/Date/Date.py: ISO fix.

2002-01-09  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py, parfs.py: VFS tweaks.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/index.html: added image
	gallery demo (requires Python Imaging Library).

2002-01-09  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* configure.in: added check for python development files

2002-01-02  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>
	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/*many*: fixed so will work
	with Python 2.2 pickling issue

	* README: added note about Python 2.1 to 2.2 upgrade issue

	* pylibs/Date/__init__.py: lagging fix after the *many* change below.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/dcomps/newsforge.pydcmp:
	fixed so it works because they changed their xml format 

2001-12-26  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex: fixed desc of <:msg:> tag

2001-12-20  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* pylibs/DateTime.py: removed

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/Makefile.in: fixed share dir permissions

	* *many*: now will work with either old-style DateTime package
	  or with new style mx.DateTime. 

2001-12-18  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* pylibs/PyDO/sapdbapi.py: added file contributed by Ulrich Eck

2001-12-18  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	an open file object.

2001-11-18  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@skunk.org>

	won't know until I make changes to the Makefiles to make the rpm
	use RPM_BUILD_ROOT, as don't feel like clobbering my
	installation!).

2001-11-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@skunk.org>

	* pylibs/AE/Executables.py (executableByTypes): added new mime
	types.

	* pylibs/AE/mime.types: created new mime types,

	* SkunkWeb/.cvsignore: now even more ignorant.

2001-11-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in: sw.conf was not being preserved
	during installation; fixed, and preserve mime.types also.

	* test/index.html: added some rudimentary tests.
	* docs/opman/opman.tex (section{Remote Components}): some
	documentation about remote components.

2001-11-02  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/userdir.py (__initHooks): changed hooks used,
	so userdir will work with httpd (cleanup was broken, as EndSession
	is only called by httpd at the end of an http session).

2001-10-30  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* 3.1.3 cut

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote/protocol.py: now returns the exception
	status flag so we don't have to resort to a hack to determine
	if the return result is in fact, an exception.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote/handler.py: now uses fullCallComponent
	to do the call.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote_client.py: now deals properly with
	the new remote call protocol

	* SkunkWeb/Services/requestHandler/requestHandler.py: fixed a
	DEBUG message so it won't barf on a tuple.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote_client.py: fixed so it works again since
	I broke it adding the rendered/expired flags to the return value
	of callComponent() DUH! !@#&!*(@#^!

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py (_pathSlashRedirect): no
	longer requires the uri since it can fetch it from the connection
	anyway.  Now uses realUri (not any munged one we might have
	replaced uri with) since we want the redirect to be relative to
	the one the browser requested, not the one we've screwed with

	* SkunkWeb/Services/userdir.py: added new userdir service

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py (CallTag.genCode): now uses new

	improvements, to reference counting.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (_processRequest): no actual

	to totally rewrite it.

	parameter to the <:import:> tag

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py: added the as optional parameter to

	* pylibs/AE/Component.py: made so you can tell whether the

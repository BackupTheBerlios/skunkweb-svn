2001-09-25  Drew Csillag  <drew@starmedia.net>

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py: never stored connection in itself
	if using cache

2001-09-24  Drew Csillag  <drew@starmedia.net>

	* 3.1beta2 cut

	* pylibs/AE/Executables.py: fixed idiocy bug introduced when
	making print statements work in STML templates

2001-09-21  Drew Csillag  <drew@starmedia.net>

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py, pylibs/DT/DTCompilerUtil: now made
	it so that if you have a multi-line <:call:> tag, you don't have
	to have the ':> on it's own line for it to work.

	* pylibs/DT/DTCompilerUtil.py, pylibs/AE/Executables.py: made
	so print statements in templates now work.

	* configure.in, SkunkWeb/configure.in: added userdir to help and
	default list of services

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection._initURI): now
	creates self.realUri so that we know what is actually requested in
	the event we screw with self.uri later.
	
	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py (_pathSlashRedirect): no
	longer requires the uri since it can fetch it from the connection
	anyway.  Now uses realUri (not any munged one we might have
	replaced uri with) since we want the redirect to be relative to
	the one the browser requested, not the one we've screwed with

	* SkunkWeb/Services/userdir.py: added new userdir service

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py (CallTag.genCode): now uses new writemultiline
	method so user doesn't need to now reall current indentation level

	* pylibs/DT/DTCompilerUtil.py (Output.writemultiline): added to
	write multiple lines at current indentation.

	when creating a new dict when dictList is empty.

2001-09-04  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (_processRequest): no actual change, 
	but marked where one might call Configuration.saveMash().  I'm not sure
	I like the saveMash() feature.

	* pylibs/ConfigLoader.py: altered to use new scopeable package;

	of debug statements since the appear to chew up a lot of
	cycles

	* SkunkWeb/Services/ae_component: performance tweaks

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/Hooks.py(KeyedHook.__call__): Only

	SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/dcomps/slashhead.pydcmp:
	Minor fixes so that they now work now that freshmeat no longer
	provides a description, and since slashdot is now a bit more picky
	about how you talk to it.

	* docs/devel/devel.tex: finagled a bit in hopes of not having
	to totally rewrite it.
	

2001-08-17  Drew Csillag  <drew@naxos.starmedia.net>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/Server.py (SkunkWebServer.reload): commented

	through __h in the generated code.

2001-08-14  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py (_dateConvertToDB): added type check to prevent a TypeError from

2001-08-13  Drew Csillag  <drew@naxos.starmedia.net>

	* configure.in, configure, docs/opman/opman.tex: no longer require
	bash since nothing appears to use it.  Also, don't care whose

	parameter to the <:import:> tag

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py: added the as optional parameter to

	put a link to the demo page and made a demo page.  Hopefully will
	have more demos soon... hint... hint...

	* pylibs/AE/Component.py: made so you can tell whether the component
	call a) was rendered or fetched from cache, or b) was expired by

	fullCallComponent and returns the text, not the flags.

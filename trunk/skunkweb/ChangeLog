2002-07-29  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/pycgi.py (_processRequest): added slash at
	beginning of PATH_INFO, if it exists; SCRIPT_FILENAME is the full
	filename of the actual file, and PATH_TRANSLATED is the same but
	contains extra path info.

2002-07-29  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* docs/devel/devel.tex: added notes about adding a new templating

	documentation before tarring everything up

2002-07-25  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/index.html: commented out
	lwn related stuff as it is closing it's doors on 8/1/02

	* configure, configure.in: added stuff pertaining to --with-runasroot

	* SkunkWeb/skunkweb.py.in: put in safety check so that if skunkweb
	is started by root, and the installation owner is not root and
	userToRunAs is *not* set, we refuse to run.

	* SkunkWeb/swmgr.in: added -r option so you can make it as if you

2002-07-25  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/pycgi.py (_processRequest): d'oh! was raising
	a PreemptiveResponse in a hook that doesn't expect such a thing
	and treats it as an error.

2002-07-23  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/constants.py (PYCGI_JOB): added constant for
	pycgi service.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/pycgi.py: start of pycgi service.  Doesn't
	contain subinterpreter module, has barely been tested so far,
	doesn't deal with sys.argv correctly, etc.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (FS.split_extra): added FS method for finding
	extra path info.

2002-07-23  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/util/cache_reaper.py.in: add @libdir@/pylibs to
	sys.path, and set default cache directory to @prefix@/cache.
	Thanks to Simo Salminen for pointing out that this would be a good
	idea.

2002-07-20  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/ae_component.py (__initConfig): error
	in specifying default docroot.

2002-07-19  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/__init__.py (__initHooks),
	SkunkWeb/Services/httpd/protocol.py: now import RequestFailed
	from requestHandler, not aecgi.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/aecgi.py: import RequestFailed from
	requestHandler.protocol, for backwards compatibility.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/requestHandler/protocol.py: moved
	RequestFailed here from aecgi.py.

2002-07-15  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/AE/MsgCatalog.py: MessageCatalogs now have a hasMessage()
	method, and getMessage can be now be used with a default value, or
	not. 

	* SkunkWeb/Services/ae_component.py (__initConfig): use
	DEFAULT_DOCROOT for mergeDefaulting into
	Configuration.documentRoot. 

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/confvars.py.in (DEFAULT_DOCROOT): captured 
	the DOCROOT configure variable.

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/ConfigAdditives.py (File, __all__): added
	RegexMatcher for location (File).

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py: now test whether sessionDict has
	the relevant keys before deleting them.

2002-07-15  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/extcgi.py (_dispenv): made it 2.1 compliant,
	and removed the if statment that should always be true.

2002-07-12  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/pil_preload.py: imports the
	entirety of the PIL package

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/UrlBuilder.py: now imports
	pil_preload if PIL is enabled

2002-07-11  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/confvars.py.in: adding.  Contains constants
	produced by configure.

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.in, SkunkWeb/Makefile.in,
	SkunkWeb/configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in,
	SkunkWeb/skunkweb.py.in, SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in,
	SkunkWeb/swpython.py.in, SkunkWeb/Services/Makefile.in,
	SkunkWeb/Services/ae_component.py,
	SkunkWeb/Services/basicauth/swpasswd.py.in,
	SkunkWeb/Services/product/productwiz.in,
	SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/LogObj.py, SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/Server.py,
	SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/bootloader.py.in,
	SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/httpd_conf.stub.in: changes to configuration
	so skunk actually works in other layouts.

2002-07-11  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/extcgi.py: fixed so it changes to the
	directory of the cgi program

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/constants.py: added CGI_JOB

	* SkunkWeb/Services/extcgi.py: added external CGI runner

2002-07-10  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* pylibs/MySQL/__init__.py: finally fixed so that using the mysql
	service, plus having userModuleCleanup turend on will now actually
	work.
	(_real_connect): got rid of the exception handler since it masked
	the traceback and appears to have no useful function in and of
	itself.  Assuming it's a Roman-leftover since he was fond of this
	sort of thing.

2002-07-05  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* pylibs/PyDO/mysqlconn.py: now allows you to use cacheUser
	without using a dictionary.

	* docs/PyDO/PyDO.tex (chapter{Operators}): added operators chapter
	and now in process of bringing this up to date.

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: fixed typo in HTTPKeepAliveTimeout
	(previously, the "a" in alive wasn't capitalized as it should've
	been)

2002-07-03  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py: applied patch to static_getUnique found on
	sourceforge that fixes the problem when *no* rows are returned.

2002-07-01  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/scopeable/scope.py (Scopeable.pop): added index argument
	to pop, which is otherwise entirely useless (I can't think why
	you'd want it remove the last element of the dictlist).

2002-06-30  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/__init__.py (getAuthorizer): made it so
	we don't need the PseudoDict thing we used to need.

2002-06-28  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES): added components for python
	website, whose absence was breaking the demo.

	* SkunkWeb/swpython.py.in: minor change to accomodate setattr
	hook. 

	* pylibs/scopeable/_scope.c: minor changes to avoid running afoul
	of the setattr hook.

	* pylibs/scopeable/scope.py (Scopeable.__setattr__): Added setattr
	hook so as to raise an exception when someone tries an attribute
	assignment.

2002-06-28  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: added comment so that hopefully we won't
	forget about authActivated

	* pylibs/DT/DTCompilerUtil.py: made so that all exprs get the line
	endings converted to the native line ending.

2002-06-28  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/userdir.py (doUserDirPre): now fixed so
	the Configuration object will clean itself up correctly;
	previously, use of userdir was incompatible with scoping the
	documentRoot. 

2002-06-27  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* pylibs/Logger.py: the logger now handles some really bizarre
	cases that shouldn't ever happen in reality (but of course have).

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/__init__.py,
	SkunkWeb/Services/auth/login.html,
	SkunkWeb/Services/auth/logout.html:
	
	fixed so that you can have two different auth schemes going at the
	same time in different dirs and still have it all work.

2002-06-26  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* 3.2.3 cut

2002-06-25  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* DT.py (DT.__call__): made so the __[thd] namespaces won't get
	hosed if an include throws an exception -- moved the unstore
	call into the finally: block
	
	* pylibs/AE/Error.py (logException): undid "fix" to make it so that
	we didn't get extra stuff in the tag traceback

	* pylibs/AE/Component.py: made it so the componentStack gets
	trimmed properly.  When adding frames, we used to blindly append
	to the componentStack which was fine unless an exception was
	handled, in which case, there might have been extra stuff in the
	componentStack (the frame that blew the exception and those frames
	between the exception raise and the handling of the exception).
	Now, if the topOfComponentStack is a valid index into the
	componentStack (due to a caught exception), we replace from the
	top to the end of the stack with a list containing the new frame,
	thus removing any frame residues left from caught exceptions.

2002-06-24  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in, SkunkWeb/configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in,
	SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/Makefile.in: made so the makefiles now work
	with BSD make.

2002-06-21  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py (_rewritePost): when other things
	go wrong on the server, delling rewriteRules from the session dict
	sometimes fails.  I'm moving it into the try block.

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c (get_stdin): changed
	(temporarily!) the level for some notice messages that were
	getting logged regardless of the configured LogLevel.

2002-06-19  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* TODO: cleaned up, added and removed.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/requestHandler/requestHandler.py: added
	missing import.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (FS.walk): fixed typo pointed out by pychecker.

2002-06-18  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/index.html, 
	SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/index.html, 
	SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/index.html, 
	SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/index.html:  added bit so that favicon.ico 
	will show up in mozilla

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in: added bit for favicon.ico

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/favicon.ico: added

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/MailServices.py: fixed way old bug.
	Had a reference to AED that would get hit when sending a message
	via SMTP would fail.

	* pylibs/parfile.py(foo): removed, as it's been useless for a while 
	now.

	* pylibs/AE/ComponentTag.py: use of __args__ would cause an error
	(used == instead of =)!

	* SkunkWeb/Services/scgi.py: fixed typo that caused problems on POSTs
	
	* SkunkWeb/Services/requestHandler/requestHandler.py: SkunkExcept
	wasn't imported so could cause problems in certain cases, fixed.

	* pylibs/prompt.py: fixed niggly bug

	* pylibs/IOTO.py: removed unused import

	* pylibs/Config.py: removed a few unused imports

	* pylibs/BasicAuth.py: fixed a few stupid bugs

	* pylibs/Authenticator.py: removed unused variable

	* pylibs/ErrorHandler.py: fixed typo, was raising CriticalError and
	should've been SkunkCriticalError

	* pylibs/AE/cfg.py: fixed typo

	* pylibs/AE/TypeTag.py: Had unused didanything variable -- removed

	* pylibs/AE/InitTags.py: was missing an import of SkunkExcept

	* pylibs/AE/ComponentTag.py: removed a useless import
	of string module

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py: fixed a DEBUG msg pointed out by 
	pychecker and changed a string.atoi to int()

2002-06-17  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* configure.in, configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in,
	SkunkWeb/configure: added reference to scgi service.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/scgi.py: added support for the SCGI protocol
	-- http://www.mems-exchange.org/software/scgi/

2002-06-12  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex: added bit about timeout rethrow

	* SkunkWeb/Services/requestHandler/requestHandler.py(SIGALRMHandler):
	now logs an error and resets the alarm before it throws the
	timeout exception, so that in the event that somebody has a
	catchall except: and thus would catch the timeout exception, we'll
	reraise SIGALRM every second in the hopes that at some point,
	they'll miss it.  Also lets the template try to deal with timeouts
	a bit better should they choose to do so.

2002-06-11  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex: Should be in good shape now.

2002-06-11  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex: going over with a fine toothed comb.
	Stopped just before "The CONNECTION Object"

	* 3.2.2 cut

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/bootloader.py.in: fixed bug that made the server
	not start with Python 2.1

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/index.html: added bits
	for python news

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/python.comp, 
	SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/dcomps/python.pydcmp:
	added rdf suckers for python news

2002-06-10  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/operators.py (SET.__escape): added some primitive
	escaping capability to SET; doesn't handle dates.

2002-06-07  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* pylibs/PyDO/README: made mention of DCOracle2

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: added warning not to use 
	OracleProcedurePackageLists with DCOracle2

	* pylibs/Oracle/__init__.py,pylibs/PyDO/oracleconn.py: should
	now work with DCOracle2

	* INSTALL: fixed error about building paper docs

	* All of this sections changes are for the fact that you previously
	couldn't put a <:compargs:> tag (or any tag that fiddled with 
	meta-info about the template) in a block tag.

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py: 
	    * added documentation for genCode in DTTag.
	    * added meta argument to genCode methods of the for, if, while, 
	      try and spool tags.
	    * made so the above block tags call genCodeChild with the meta
	      argument

	* pylibs/DT/DTCompilerUtil.py(genCodeChild): made all arguments 
	mandatory (see comment about DTC.py), as well as calls genCode on
	Tag instances with the meta argument when they are block (as opposed
	to empty) tags.

	* pylibs/DT/DTC.py(compileTemplate): made all arguments mandatory
	since a) it's always called that way and b) it wouldn't work if you
	didn't anyway.

2002-06-06  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/dcomps/lwndaily.pydcmp:
	fixed so uses urlopen

	* 3.2.1 cut.

2002-06-06  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/operators.py (SET): now works with sets of length 1.

2002-06-06  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/__init__.py: now PlainCookieAuth will set
	conn.remote(User|Password) when having just logged in.  Previously,
	the login method didn't set these as it should have.

2002-06-05  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/ConfigLoader.py (loadConfig): now exec config files
	in {}, ns rather than ns, ns.

2002-06-05  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/Server.py: added comment at the top to remind
	us that in the event that we add an import, that we add that import
	to _stupidfunc in the bootloader

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/bootloader.py.in(init): now has some logic
	to produce a true module snapshot that should always do the right
	thing so reload will work

	* SkunkWeb/skunkweb.py.in: adjusted for bootloader change so reload
	should now work properly -- again

2002-06-03  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: fixed a goof that showed
	up when building against Apache 1 due to a misplaced #endif

2002-05-30  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py: proper handling of date strings where 
	the timezone is GMT+ something as opposed to GMT- something

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: SkunkWebExclude option 
	now removed for Apache 2.x

2002-05-25  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/vfs/__init__.py: now import two more exceptions from
	vfs.py. 

	* pylibs/DT/DT.py (DT.__store_ns, DT.__unstore_ns): fix for
	calling an include from a top-level python document which does not
	have "__t", "__h", or "__d".

2002-05-24  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/httpd/__init__.py, SkunkWeb/Services/aecgi.py:
	add request handler in ServerStart hook, not directly on import.

2002-05-24  Andrew Csillag  <acsillag@unix-101-21.hq.communityconnect.com>

	* pylibs/SocketMan/SocketMan.py(SocketMan._reset): now doesn't
	barf if the socket removal fails

	* pylibs/AE/CodeSources.py(updatecache): now attempts to do
	something a bit more intelligent when errors occur during reload

2002-05-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py: forgot to add a check for the case
	when rewrite is loaded before templating in choosing the 404
	handler.

2002-05-17  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py (PyDO.static_getSQLWhere): fix for 
	dealing with no results

2002-05-15  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/__init__.py: importing ERROR

	* SkunkWeb/configure.in: add auth to list of services.

2002-05-14  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/__init__.py (PlainSessionAuth.__init__):
	removed reference to passwordSlot, which is outdated.

2002-05-10  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py (Status404): added a
	DynamicRewriter subclass that raises a 404.  If templating
	is (or is to be, to the extent it is possible to determine)
	loaded,  it uses templating's 404 handler by default.

2002-05-09  Andrew Csillag  <drew@yahoo.com>

	* docs/html/Makefile: no more dependancy on the long missing devel.bib

	* docs/devel/devel.tex: now will build (had extraneous \'s in it)

	* docs/README: new

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/UrlBuilder.py(hidden): now encodes 
	key/value pairs where the value is None as "" instead of not putting
	in the hidden tag altogether

	* INSTALL: added doc about building/obtaining the documentation

	* SkunkWeb/Services/httpd/protocol.py(marshalResponse):
	pretty much rewritten so can add a Server: header if there wasn't 
	one already and still do the proper handling of the Status header.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py(_initHeaders): no longer
	adds default Server: header

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: now calls 
	ap_add_version_component to get SkunkWeb/vvv in the Server: header

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/Makefile.in: now adds -DSW_VERSION=vvvv
	so mod_skunkweb puts the correct thing in the server header.

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/httpd_conf.stub: added bit for new option
	SkunkWebExpose

2002-05-07  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: fixed skunkweb_handler so it 
	should behave properly w.r.t. VirtualHosts.

2002-05-06  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/AE/ComponentTag.py (ComponentTag.genCode,
	DataComponentTag.genCode): __args__ was broken, because references
	to DictType gave rise to NameErrors.  I believe that the contents
	of the types module used to be imported into the component
	namespace, and this is a hangover from that.

2002-05-03  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/__init__.py (__initFlag): adding config
	option for merging querystring into post data.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection._convertArgs):
	bug fix for TypeError thrown by cgi.py at times.
	(HTTPConnection._initArgs): use new config option for merging
	querystring into post data.

2002-05-02  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* FAQ: added entry about path info

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py(HTTPConnection._initArgs):
	made it so that:

	1) empty form arguments are passed through.  Previously, they were
	   dropped, but it generally wasn't a problem since you usually
	   used <:args:> or CONN.args.get(foo), but occasionally it was
	   confusing.
	
	2) on a POST request, we now also gather what would usually be GET
	   arguments also (say your form action is /foo/bar.html?baz=fred
	   and it was a POST, you'll now get the baz argument (set to
	   fred, of course))

2002-05-01  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py (_dorewrite): fixed typo.

2002-04-29  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: removed part where you specified the
	password slot for the PlainSessionAuth authorizer since we don't
	do that anymore.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/__init__.py: added more documentation in
	the comment describing authorizer objects as well as did a few
	grammar/spelling/capitalization fixes.

	The SessionAuthBase also no longer stores the password in the
	session.  That was pretty stupid.  If somebody actually wants
	that, they can do it themselves.

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: removed cookieauth stuff, added auth stuff

	* configure, configure.in: removed cookieauth stuff, added auth
	stuff
	
	* SkunkWeb/configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in: removed cookieauth 
	stuff, added auth stuff

	* SkunkWeb/Services/auth/{login.html,__init__.py,logout.html}:
	added new auth service

	* SkunkWeb/Services/cookieauth: whole directory removed.
	Superceded by new auth service which is now the swiss army knife
	of web authentication.

2002-04-27  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/cookieauth/__init__.py: cleaned up so that you
	can provide arbitrary authenticator info that only somewhat cookie
	related???

2002-04-27  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/ConfigLoader.py (loadConfig): fix so that multiple config
	files/Include directive will work as promised.

	* FAQ: updated.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py (__getcompiled): now compile
	regexes in Configuration.rewriteRules, if they aren't already
	compiled. (DynamicRewriter, Redirect): extended service so it can
	perform take functions as replacements, as in re.sub, and, with
	DynamicRewriter, have access to the connection and sessionDict.  A
	Redirect class added as example and trial run.

2002-04-26  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* pylibs/AE/cacheKey/cachekey.c(encodeSingle): now will encode
	DateTime objects so they can be part of a cache key, and improved
	the error message raised when an object that cannot be used for a
	cache key component is used.

2002-04-26  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/AE/Executables.py (STMLExecutable.mergeNamespaces): now
	correctly raises exception (was missing parens around tuple).
	
2002-04-24  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/Makefile.in: fixes so that it works with
	both Apache 1 and Apache 2

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: now handles Apache 2!

2002-04-19  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py: A number of changes with regard to how
	datatypes, especially dates, times and intervals, are handled.
	WARNING: The interval code is unfinished.

2002-04-18  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/cookieauth/login.html: now handles invalid
	login properly w.r.t. original query args.

	* pylibs/PyDO/pgenscript.py: applied clean up patch from Greg
	Brauer

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py (convertResultRows): fixed case problem
	in type matching

2002-04-17  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/postconn.py (_isString): added support for bpchar.

2002-04-17  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* NEWS: updating for what will be 3.2.1 

	* pylibs/armor.py: added dearmor_detail so you can find out 
	where something died

	* configure, configure.in: added cookieauth stuff
	
	* SkunkWeb/configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in: added cookieauth stuff

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: added cookieauth stuff

	* SkunkWeb/Services/cookieauth/{__init__.py,login.html,logout.html}:
	added cookie authentication service

2002-04-13  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* SkunkWeb/mod_skunkweb/mod_skunkweb.c: first shot towards Apache
	2 compatibility.  Doesn't compile for it yet, but it's getting
	there.

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py: fixed bug in scatterFetchPost when got no
	results back from the query.  Thanks to Karl Putland
	<kperacles@yahoo.com>.

2002-04-09  Jacob Smullyan  <jsmullyan@wnyc.org>

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py (CachedComponent.__init__): stale was being
	set to precisely the wrong value; thanks to Stephen Coursen for
	catching this (*immediately* after the release of 3.2!)

2002-04-09  Andrew Csillag  <drew@yahoo.com>

	* SkunkWeb 3.2 cut

2002-04-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/Date/TimeUtil.py (untilString): fixes what looks like
	a cut-and-paste error that has been lurking here since 3.0.

2002-04-02  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection.extract_args): 
	fixed bug that produced UnboundLocalError in some cases

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/thumbnail.py: fixed
	dumb typo that produced NameError.

2002-03-31  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/thumbnail.py: now use
	CONNECTION.extract_args.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/pars: removing from cvs and distro.

	* SkunkWeb/configure.in, SkunkWeb/configure: remove par script,
	added productwiz.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/Makefile.in: put productwiz script in bin/.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productwiz.in: added script to start
	the product wizard, for the truly lazy.

2002-03-30  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: fixed typo in documentation of
	rewrite service, and added documentation of Include directive.

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/ConfigAdditives.py (__all__): added
	support for "from ConfigAdditives import *"; added Include
	directive

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/KickStart.py (CONFIG_STRING): now do 
	"from ConfigAdditives import *", which is now preceded by
	the import from SkunkWeb.constants (ConfigAdditives clobbers
	some of the latter)

2002-03-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES): adding Drew's new files to 
	makefile

2002-03-18  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/newsvac.comp,
	dcomps/newsvac.pydcmp: added

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/geeknews/index.html,
	dcomps/newsforge.pydcmp: fixes now that newsforge and linux.com
	have changed a bit

2002-03-03  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in (userModuleCleanup): this was being turned
	on in this conf file, by mistake; the default should be 0.

2002-02-24  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productwiz.py: adding a rather
	silly product-making wizard.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productmaker.py (makeProduct): fix for
	when there are no libs.

2002-02-23  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection._convertArgs):
	fix for TypeError (query.keys() when query is None)

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/manifest.py (write_manifest): some api 
	modifications for productmaker.py.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/productmaker.py: so far, just a
	function that builds a product archive; script and wizard still
	incomplete.

2002-02-22  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (ProductMountPoint): 
	now use dynamic mounting for product docroots.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (MultiFS): dynamic mounting
	is now possible.

	* pylibs/wizard.py: adding Rich Salz's wizard.py (version 2.0),
	with his permission.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.load): now do
	version comparisons using strnatcmp.

2002-02-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/__init__.py, 
	SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.__reallyload):
	removed reference to defaultProductLibdir and kin; corrected
	docstring some.

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/bootloader.py.in (init): for restart,
	uninstall the import hook.	

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (_keyRE): I forgot to compile this regex,
	causing an error on swmgr restart.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py: removed unnecessary
	import. 

	* pylibs/vfs/importer.py (uninstall): fixed typo; no longer
	delete __oldimport__ (leaving it around doesn't hurt).

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py (ZipFS.isdir), pylibs/vfs/tarfs.py
	(TarFS.isdir): 	no longer raise an exception when calling isdir on
	a nonexistent file. 

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.__reallyload): use
	the new vfs.importer; no longer mount the libfs on the multifs,
	since it is easier to import directly from the archive file, and
	the sys.path entry refers to the archive file fs by registered key.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (VFSRegistry, registerFS): added vfs registry,
	to support vfs urls, used by vfs.importer and product service.

	* pylibs/vfs/importer.py: totally rewritten to use Gordon
	McMillan's iu module (with his generous permission).

2002-02-20  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/ServiceRegistry.py (registerService): cosmetic
	improvements.

	* pylibs/MySQL/__init__.py (initUser): now tolerate
	calls to initUser on users who have already been initialized (the
	call then has no effect).  This fixes a problem pointed out by
	Spruce Weber with restarting the server.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/__init__.py: autocreate
	product directory.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/loader.py (Product.__reallyload):
	stopped using a vfs importer for directory products.
	(Product.load): improved dependency check -- optionally
	can include version in dependency. (Product): moved static
	methods to module methods.

	* configure.in, configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in,
	SkunkWeb/configure: added reference to product service.

2002-02-19  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/product/: adding first cut at a
	product service.  loader.py has a Product class, and loads
	products; manifest.py reads and writes manifest files.

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py (ZipFS.__init__), pylibs/vfs/tarfs.py
	(TarFS.__init__):  default value for root parameter was wrong in
	both cases; fixed.

	* pylibs/vfs/tarfs.py (TarFS.__init__): support for root
	parameter. 

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py (ZipFS.__init__): support for root
	parameter. 

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (FileNotFoundException,
	NotWriteableException): some new VFSException subclasses.	
	(FS.isWriteable): FS implementations can now declare whether
	they are writeable.  This is most useful in the cases when they
	aren't, as an fs being writeable doesn't mean that a particular
	write operation is possible.

	* pylibs/vfs/pathutil.py (Archive): added support for "root"
	parameter. 

2002-02-18  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:args:>}}):
	another LaTeX typo, grrr.

2002-02-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:args:>}}): forgot 
	an "\end{verbatim}"; fixed.

2002-02-16  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:args:>}}): added
	documentation for CONNECTION.extract_args.

	* pylibs/vfs/importer.py: still very primitive import hook for vfs.

2002-02-15  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: added rewrite documentation.

	* configure.in, configure, Skunkweb/configure.in, Skunkweb/configure: 
	added rewrite to list of services

	* FAQ: Added a faq entry about cgi directories that has been on the 
	website for some while, but which I had forgotten to put here.

2002-02-14  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/rewrite.py: Added Spruce Weber's rewrite service. 

	* pylibs/Authenticator.py (Authenticator.authenticate): this method
	was dying with an error whenever someone tried a username that was
	not in the auth file; fixed.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/httpd/protocol.py
	(HTTPProtocol.marshalResponse): necessary check for None.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py (requestHandler):
	removed optional logging for 404s and now log to access rather
	than error log.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (HTTPConnection.extract_args):
	added a method that corresponds to the <:args:> tag to the
	connection object; returns a dictionary rather than automatically
	updating the local namespace.

2002-02-13  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (_processRequest): added check
	for None to prevent SW barfing on a debug statement

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py (requestHandler):
	optionally log to error log when there is a 404 (vfs error) and
	raise a 500 for other errors (which weren't supposed to occur, but
	did)

2002-02-13  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py: fix for getPathAndMinistat which broke pretty 
	much everything. 

2002-02-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/SkunkWeb/Hooks.py: moved class definitions to a pylib
	(hooks.py) 

2002-02-08  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* SkunkWeb 3.2 beta 1 cut and PyDO 1.1 beta 1 cut

2002-02-07  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: removed references to pars, which no longer
	works; used @prefix@ instead of hard-coded /usr/local/skunk in a
	number of places; revised documentation of documentRootFS

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES): removed a directory name that
	was producing a warning during make install

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py (Configuration.documentRootFS, 
	_getPathFSAndMinistat): changed documentRootFS from a list
	to a single instance.  Add _getPathAndMinistat, since now
	it is pointless to return the fs, but left a working version
	of _getPathFSAndMinistat, now deprecated.

2002-02-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (PathPropertyStore.acquireWithAncestor): 
	snazzed up acquisition facility by delegating to this method,
	which permits one to search just a segment of a treepath, and
	specify a default or not.

2002-02-05  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/vfs/pickleProps.py: path property store that uses pickle
	files.

	* pylibs/vfs/shelfProps.py (ShelfPathPropertyStore.properties):
	removed haspath(), left in by mistake; switched from gdbm to
	bsddb. 

	* SkunkWeb/Services/sessionHandler/FSSessionStore.py
	(FSSessionStoreImpl.reapOldRecords): fixed typo that caused it to
	crash; also moved one line out of a loop. 

	* pylibs/vfs/__init__.py: made TarFS also an optional import;
	wanted to import AEPathPropertyStore, but that led to a circular
	import dependency; hmmmm.

	* pylibs/vfs/shelfProps.py, zodbProps.py: use skunklib.normpath2.

	* pylibs/skunklib/__init__.py (normpath2): added a wrapper around
	skunklib normpath that removes final slashes for those cases when
	you want that.  I should add it to the C module, to be in the
	spirit of things, eventually.

	* pylibs/vfs/aeProps.py: Added a read-only PathPropertyStore that
	uses python data components to store the properties.  You want a
	management interface? Take this!

	* pylibs/AE/Executables.py (PythonExecutable.run): indentation
	problem led to error if a data component didn't return anything

2002-02-04  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* configure.in, configure, SkunkWeb/configure.in,
	SkunkWeb.configure: remove references to pars service.	

	* pylibs/vfs/__init__.py: try to import the ZODBPathPropertyStore,
	and pass in case of error.

	* pylibs/vfs/zodbProps.py (ZODBPathPropertyStore): added
	a PathPropertyStore that uses ZODB/ZEO.

	* pylibs/vfs/shelfProps.py (ShelfPathPropertyStore): tested
	and made to work multi-process.

	* test/vfs_testsuite.py: added some tests for vfs.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (PathPropertyStore): Added new methods to
	interface, delproperty (should remove a existing property
	associated with an existing path) and acquire (walks up the
	directory tree looking for a property if not found).

2002-02-03  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* pylibs/PyDO/sapdbconn.py: minor fix from Ulrich Eck

2002-02-03  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote_client.py (getRemoteException, etc):
	revamped the remote exception generation code, taking into account
	the possibility of string exceptions

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote/test.py (runInteractive): for test
	script, added support for regular components

2002-02-01  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/sessionHandler/__init__.py (__initSession): 
	forgot to import LogObj

2002-01-29  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* pylibs/static.py: after having dropped this fix that actually
	makes this stuff work on 2.2, finally reinstated the fix because
	__call__ was being improperly handled.

2002-01-28  Andrew Csillag  <drew@thoughttrack.com>

	* 3.2beta0 cut

2002-01-27  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py (PyDOBase.get): self.get(columnname,
	default) now returns default if self._dict[columnname]==None. 

2002-01-26  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/AE/Cache.py (_fixPath): _normpath is now applied to the
	entire resulting path, which solves a problem with zipfs.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/comp/listing.pydcmp: now
	uses the vfs.

	* pylibs/vfs/vfs.py (LocalFS.__init__): now take an argument,
	"root", which specifies the root of the fs tree.

	* pylibs/PyDO/mysqlconn.py (_dateConvertFromDB): fixed dumb goof
	-- I had thought DateTime.DateTime was a class, not a function
	that returned an instance of a type, and passed it to isinstance;
	now do a correct type check.

2002-01-25  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* Makefile.in, SkunkWeb/Makefile.in, pylibs/Makefile.in: made so
	BSD Make won't barf on them.

2002-01-23  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES): fixed typo.

2002-01-23  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* pylibs/PyDO/doc: updated MySQL documentation.

	* pylibs/vfs/pathutil.py (Archive.listdir): fixed cut-and-paste
	error.

2002-01-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in (DEMO_FILES, DEMO_DIRS): fix so that the
	image gallery gets installed.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/index.html: moved
	index.html to index.inc; index.html now just consists of an
	include tag.  

	* pylibs/PyDO/operators.py (SET): added support for IN.

2002-01-21  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: documented Configuration.mimeHandlers.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/__init__.py (__initHooks): removed
	dumb comment.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py: Added
	Configuration.mimeHandlers, for optional mimetype-specific request
	handlers.


2002-01-17  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py (PyDO.static_getSome): Fixes for case when
	an empty list should be returned, and to getTupleWhere and
	getSomeWhere for cases when arguments are empty.


2002-01-14  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/operators.py (tupleToSQL): Fixed nasty bug caused by
	stray colon.

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDO.py: cleaned up by deleting old useless
	commented-out code.

2002-01-13  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/PyDO/mysqlconn.py (PyDOMySQL.__unpackConnectArgs): bug
	fixes.  After doing an insert, c.fetchall() returns an empty
	sequence rather than raising an error; c.fetchone() will return
	None in that case.

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDBI.py (DBIGetConnection): Fixed some painfully
	dumb typos I introduced.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/comp/list_thumbnails.dcmp:
	Use component stack to determine the current path of this
	component, to determine where thumbnails.py is (if not given to
	the component)

	* SkunkWeb/sw.conf.in: documented new mysql service configuration
	variables, and made minor correction to description of
	sessionHandler.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/mysql/__init__.py: modified to use the newly
	refurbished MySQL pylib.

	* pylibs/MySQL/__init__.py: modified to use MySQLdb, optionally
	perform a rollback step, and optionally perform a connection
	validation check before handing out a connection.

	* pylibs/PyDO/PyDBI.py (DBIGetConnection): modified to accept both
	connect strings and dictionaries of connect parameters.

	* pylibs/PyDO/mysqlconn.py: modified to use MySQLdb and take a
	dictionary of connect parameters (for interoperability with the
	MySQL pylib).


2002-01-11  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/comp/list_thumbnails.dcmp:
	use the new queryargs argument to <:img:>.

	* docs/stmlrefer/stmlrefer.tex (section{\texttt{<:img:>}}): Added
	documentation of queryargs argument to <:img:> tag.
	(section{\texttt{<:include:>}}): documented the .inc and .pyinc
	extensions. 

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/HTMLTags.py (ImageTag.genCode):
	Modified <:img:> tag to take queryargs.

2002-01-10  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/index.html: acknowledged the
	existence of the gallery demo.

	* pylibs/Date/Date.py: ISO fix.

2002-01-09  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* pylibs/vfs/zipfs.py, parfs.py: VFS tweaks.

	* SkunkWeb/sample_webdocs/demo/gallery/index.html: added image
	gallery demo (requires Python Imaging Library).

	won't know until I make changes to the Makefiles to make the rpm

	types.

	* pylibs/AE/mime.types: created new mime types,

	* SkunkWeb/.cvsignore: now even more ignorant.

2001-11-06  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Makefile.in: sw.conf was not being preserved
	during installation; fixed, and preserve mime.types also.

	* test/index.html: added some rudimentary tests.

	documentation about remote components.

2001-11-02  Jacob Smullyan  <smulloni@smullyan.org>

	* SkunkWeb/Services/userdir.py (__initHooks): changed hooks used,
	so userdir will work with httpd (cleanup was broken, as EndSession
	is only called by httpd at the end of an http session).

2001-10-30  Andrew Csillag  <drew@localhost.localdomain>

	* 3.1.3 cut

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote/protocol.py: now returns the exception
	status flag so we don't have to resort to a hack to determine
	if the return result is in fact, an exception.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote/handler.py: now uses fullCallComponent
	to do the call.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote_client.py: now deals properly with
	the new remote call protocol

	* SkunkWeb/Services/requestHandler/requestHandler.py: fixed a
	DEBUG message so it won't barf on a tuple.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/remote_client.py: fixed so it works again since
	I broke it adding the rendered/expired flags to the return value
	of callComponent() DUH! !@#&!*(@#^!

	* SkunkWeb/Services/templating/Handler.py (_pathSlashRedirect): no
	longer requires the uri since it can fetch it from the connection
	anyway.  Now uses realUri (not any munged one we might have
	replaced uri with) since we want the redirect to be relative to
	the one the browser requested, not the one we've screwed with

	* SkunkWeb/Services/userdir.py: added new userdir service

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py (CallTag.genCode): now uses new

	improvements, to reference counting.

	* SkunkWeb/Services/web/protocol.py (_processRequest): no actual

	to totally rewrite it.

	parameter to the <:import:> tag

	* pylibs/DT/DTTags.py: added the as optional parameter to

	* pylibs/AE/Component.py: made so you can tell whether the

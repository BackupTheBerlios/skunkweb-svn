Changes in 3.2.1 (not yet released)
========================================
* new auth service
* Assorted PyDO fixes, notably support for more PostgreSQL types
* Caching fix for stale 
* Apache 2 support.
* DateTime objects can now be used as arguments to cacheable components
* rewrite fixes and feature additions
* usual array of general bug fixes
* mod_skunkweb now properly reports it's existence in the Server header

Changes in 3.2 beta 3
========================================
* added a product service and product-packaging utility, which permits components and python
  modules, including services, to be bundled together and deployed.  Requires MultiFS as the 
  documentRootFS, which is now a single FS.
* userModuleCleanup now off by default.
* vfs fixes.
* MySQL fixes.
* rewrite service, for url rewriting (contributed by Spruce Weber)
* added extract_args method to HTTPConnection, corresponding to the STML <:args:> tag.
* Hook and KeyedHook now live in a pylib (hooks.py)

Changes in 3.2 beta 1
========================================
* pars removed (since we have zipfs and tarfs, pars is redundant)
* vfs fixes
* new vfs properties
* sapdb fix - Ulrich Eck
* remote component call exception fix
* beginnings of a test suite
* static/PyDO now *actually* works on Python 2.2

Changes in 3.2 beta 0
========================================
* remote component fixes
* doc updates
* caching fixes
* misc output fixes
* Now have a CGI adaptor -- swcgi.  See docs for details
* new image gallery demo, with auto-generated (and cached) thumbnails;
  requires PIL
* new suffixes for includes (.inc and .pyinc)
* optional enhancement to <:img:> tag if PIL is installed 
  (auto-generates height and width)
* many PyDO improvements, including a SAP driver and *three* 
  new ways of specifying custom WHERE clauses; pydoObj.get(column,
  default) will now return default where the value for column is
  NULL. 
* services can now easily provide mime-type-specific request 
  handlers
* upgraded MySQL support to use MySQLdb
* works with Python 2.2 as well as 2.1.x
* now accesses resources via a vfs layer; resources can be stored in 
  zip and tar archives as well as the local filesystem.  The pars
  service, which used a python-specific archive format, is no longer
  supported. 
* Because of the vfs, Configuration.documentRoot is being gradually
  phased out, and will probably not be present in 3.2 final.
  The new mechanism for controlling where resources come from is 
  Configuration.documentRootFS, which in this release, is a list of
  possible filesystems (for various reasons this will probably change
  quite soon to a single fs rather than a list).

Changes from 3.0 to 3.1
========================================
* Major performance tweaks.  Should now be about 30% faster overall.
* Now supports FastCGI
* PyDO improvements (mainly PostgreSQL related)
* new service - userdir - which makes it so that requests to /~user/foo
  will go to <users_home_directory>/public_html/foo
* print statements in <:call:> tags now work.
* <:call:> tag now handles multiline expr argument properly.  Now you
  can do things like:
<:call `def foo(x):
   return 'the value is %s' % x
print foo(3)`:>
* PostgreSQL fixes
* UNIX domain socket fixes
* PyDO classes can now be defined in non-modules
* Now can have a template that gets executed for directories that don't
  have an index document.

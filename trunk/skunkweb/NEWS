Changes from 3.0 to 3.1
========================================
* Major performance tweaks.  Should now be about 30% faster overall.
* Now supports FastCGI
* PyDO improvements (mainly PostgreSQL related)
* new service - userdir - which makes it so that requests to /~user/foo
  will go to <users_home_directory>/public_html/foo
* print statements in <:call:> tags now work.
* <:call:> tag now handles multiline expr argument properly.  Now you
  can do things like:
<:call `def foo(x):
   return 'the value is %s' % x
print foo(3)`:>
* PostgreSQL fixes
* UNIX domain socket fixes
* PyDO classes can now be defined in non-modules
* Now can have a template that gets executed for directories that don't
  have an index document.
